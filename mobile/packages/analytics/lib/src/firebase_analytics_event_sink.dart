/// The underlying [FirebaseAnalytics] instance is resolved lazily on first
/// use rather than at construction. Trackers create this sink as a field
/// initializer (often via app-wide singletons that are built well before
/// `Firebase.initializeApp()` in some contexts, and never initialized at all
/// under `flutter test`). Touching `FirebaseAnalytics.instance` eagerly would
/// throw `[core/no-app]` and crash those call sites; deferring — and
/// failing closed when Firebase is unavailable — keeps analytics a no-op
/// instead of a crash.
