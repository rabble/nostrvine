/// Generates closed captions from an audio file using the operating system's
/// on-device speech recognition.
///
/// This is a best-effort, last-resort transcription path: accuracy depends on
/// the audio quality and the on-device recognizer, so results should be
/// presented as editable suggestions rather than authoritative captions.
///
/// The input is typically the WAV file produced by `pro_video_editor` audio
/// extraction. Apple platforms accept any audio container the OS can read;
/// Android requires a 16-bit integer or 32-bit float PCM WAV, which this
/// class converts to the 16 kHz mono PCM the platform recognizer expects.
///
/// On Android the platform `SpeechRecognizer` supports file input from
/// Android 14 on; older devices and devices without Google's on-device
/// recognition service throw [SpeechRecognizerUnavailableException].

  /// Creates a caption generator.

  /// Transcribes the audio file at [audioPath] into word-level
  /// [CaptionSegment]s ordered by start time.
  ///
  /// Use `groupCaptionSegments` to merge the word-level result into
  /// display-ready caption cues. Returns an empty list when no speech was
  /// recognized.
  ///
  /// [localeIdentifier] selects the recognition language as a BCP-47 tag
  /// (e.g. `en-US`); underscores are normalized to hyphens. Defaults to the
  /// device locale. On Android, word end times are approximated from the next
  /// word's start because the platform only reports start offsets.
  ///
  /// [preferOnDeviceRecognition] keeps recognition on-device on Apple
  /// platforms whenever the locale supports it; otherwise Apple's
  /// server-based recognition is used. Android always runs on-device.
  ///
  /// Throws:
  ///
  /// * [AudioFileNotFoundException] if [audioPath] does not exist.
  /// * [UnsupportedAudioFormatException] if the audio cannot be read
  ///   (Android WAV requirements above).
  /// * [SpeechNotAuthorizedException] if speech recognition is not authorized:
  ///   the user denied it (Apple), or the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission the
  ///   platform recognizer requires is not granted (Android).
  /// * [SpeechRecognizerUnavailableException] if the device or locale has no
  ///   recognizer — on Android also below Android 14 or without Google's
  ///   on-device recognition service.
  /// * [TranscriptionFailedException] for any other recognizer failure, or if
  ///   reading or writing the audio during Android WAV preparation fails.
  /// * [UnsupportedError] on platforms other than Android, iOS, and macOS.
