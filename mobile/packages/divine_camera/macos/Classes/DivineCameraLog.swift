/// Bridges relevant native diagnostics to the Dart side so they are captured
/// by the app's `UnifiedLogger` and included in bug-report log dumps.
///
/// Native recording code calls these methods (instead of bare `print`) for the
/// handful of events worth surfacing to support: audio-session configuration,
/// recording start/stop, and asset-writer failures. Per-frame / verbose
/// logging must stay on `print` so it does not flood the captured buffer.
///
/// `DivineCameraPlugin` installs `sink` at registration to forward each entry
/// over the method channel. Before that is wired (or in unit/host contexts)
/// entries fall back to the console only.
