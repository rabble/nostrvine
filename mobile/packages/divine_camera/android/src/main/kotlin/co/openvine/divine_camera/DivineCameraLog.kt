/**
 * Bridges relevant native diagnostics to the Dart side so they are captured by
 * the app's `UnifiedLogger` and included in bug-report log dumps.
 *
 * Native recording code calls these methods (instead of bare [Log]) for the
 * handful of events worth surfacing to support: audio-permission denial,
 * recording finalize errors, encoder-fallback retries, and audio-source state
 * transitions. Per-frame / verbose logging must stay on [Log] so it does not
 * flood the captured buffer.
 *
 * `DivineCameraPlugin` installs [sink] when attached to the engine to forward
 * each entry over the method channel. Before that is wired (or in unit-test
 * contexts) entries fall back to logcat only.
