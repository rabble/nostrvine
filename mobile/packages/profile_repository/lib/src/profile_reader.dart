/// The subset of [ProfileRepository] that reads profile data without ever
/// signing or publishing.
///
/// This exists to make a **security boundary compile-time enforceable**.
/// `profileRepositoryProvider` withholds the repository until the
/// signer-backed `NostrClient` has rebuilt for the active identity, which
/// prevents a publish from being signed by the wrong key (#1048). But that
/// same gate was also withholding purely local Drift reads, so the signed-in
/// user's own name and avatar were replaced by a generated placeholder for
/// the whole relay-connect window (#6423).
///
/// `profileReadRepositoryProvider` therefore hands over a [ProfileReader] as
/// soon as the identity is known. Because the type cannot express
/// `saveProfileEvent`, `claimUsername`, `releaseUsername` or
/// `drivePendingSave`, a consumer of the loose provider cannot publish even
/// by accident — the ungated phase carries a pubkey but no client, so signing
/// there is unsafe while Drift reads are not.
///
/// Every member below is signer-free and relay-optional: each either reads
/// Drift directly or falls back to a public, unauthenticated funnelcake REST
/// call.
///
/// **Do not widen this interface without re-checking that invariant.** The
/// write-intent members (`cacheProfile`, `deleteCachedProfile`,
/// `enqueuePendingSave`, `clearPendingSave`, `resetInterruptedPendingSave`)
/// are deliberately absent too — they do not sign, but a caller reaching for
/// them through the read handle is a design smell worth catching in review.
/// `mobile/scripts/check_profile_read_write_split.sh` guards the indirect
/// route a type cannot see.
