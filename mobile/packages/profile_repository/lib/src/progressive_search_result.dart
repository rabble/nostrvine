// ABOUTME: Per-source provenance types for progressive user search.
// ABOUTME: Lets the bloc/UI distinguish true-empty from any-source-failed.
//
// The repository's `searchUsersProgressive` consults three sources in
// order: local SQLite cache, the Funnelcake REST API, and NIP-50 relay
// search. Each phase records its outcome in a `Map<SearchSource,
// SearchSourceStatus>` that travels with every progressive yield. The
// bloc reads this map to derive `isDegradedEmpty` — the state that drives
// the UI to show a retry affordance instead of a misleading
// "No results found" when every source failed.
//
