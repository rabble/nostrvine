  /// that cannot all reach `ProfileRepository` — the classic-viner seed import
  /// re-runs on every manifest bump.
  ///
  /// Writing either count refreshes `followerCountsUpdatedAt`, which answers
  /// one question for two readers: *when were these counts last written from
  /// a source we trust?*
  ///
  /// - [getStats] and [deleteExpired] use it as the retention clock, keeping a
  ///   row whose counts are newer than [profileFollowerCountsCacheDuration]
  ///   even after the rest of the row has expired.
  /// - `FollowRepository`'s relay-fallback hysteresis uses it to decide when a
  ///   baseline is old enough that a lower relay count should be accepted.
  ///
  /// Those two readers agree because every writer withholds an ambiguous
  /// `{0, 0}` response rather than storing it, so a stamp always means real
  /// data arrived. A REST write and the hysteresis path cannot interleave:
  /// when REST answers with a signal `getFollowerStats` returns before
  /// hysteresis runs, and when it does not, no counts are written at all.
