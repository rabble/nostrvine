/// ### Mutation serialization
///
/// Every bell toggle is a read-modify-write on one NIP-33 replaceable event.
/// Two concurrent toggles would each read the same base set and the second
/// publish would drop the first's change. Mutations are therefore chained
/// per owner: each awaits the previous one's completion and reads the set
/// that mutation produced, so a rapid on/off/on sequence converges instead
/// of racing.
///
/// The chain is per owner rather than per creator on purpose — all bells live
/// in a *single* event, so serializing per creator would still race.
///
/// ### Unreadable lists are never a base for a publish
///
/// The event is replaceable, so a publish deletes every member it omits.
/// An unreachable relay pool therefore cannot be treated as an empty list:
/// reads that did not reach a relay produce no snapshot at all, mutations
/// against a missing snapshot fail without publishing, and
/// [watchSubscriptions] stays silent so the UI keeps its control disabled.
