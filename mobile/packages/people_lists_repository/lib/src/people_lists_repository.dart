/// Implementations compose a `NostrClient` for relay IO and a local cache for
/// offline reads. Callers interact with this interface only; they must not
/// reach into lower layers.
///
/// All publish operations return a [PeopleListPublishResult] that reports
/// whether the event was submitted to at least one relay socket. The
/// repository does **not** wait for relay `OK` acknowledgements.
