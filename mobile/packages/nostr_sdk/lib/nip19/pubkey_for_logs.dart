/// call site's own wording when the absence itself is diagnostic, such as a
/// record that predates the field. Returns a marker for the empty string, and
/// returns anything
/// that is neither an encodable 32-byte hex key nor a decodable npub — a short
/// hex, a garbage string off a relay — unchanged and whole. These call sites
/// sit inside `Log.error` handlers holding remote-supplied input, so a
/// formatter that threw would turn a diagnostic line into a crash.
///
/// An `nsec` or `ncryptsec` is redacted rather than rendered. Truncation is not
/// a security control, so the whole value is dropped: a secret must not reach a
/// log sink at all. Reaching this branch means a caller has a bug, but the
