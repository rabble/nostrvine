  ///
  /// ## What acceptance means
  ///
  /// `OK true` means a relay accepted the event for writing — NIP-01 defines
  /// the flag as "accepted by the relay", and Divine's relay acknowledges
  /// from an in-memory queue and commits to storage afterwards. Even
  /// [PublishOutcome.acceptedByAll] is therefore a statement about breadth of
  /// acceptance, never a durability guarantee. Do not surface it to a user as
  /// "saved".
  ///
  /// Nothing in this client republishes to relays that did not accept, so a
  /// partial publish stays partial. That makes
  /// [PublishOutcome.acceptedByAll] a poor gate for anything the user is
  /// waiting on: one pool member that is down, wedged, or refusing blocks it
  /// on every attempt, and the pool keeps relays it never managed to connect
  /// to. Gate progress on [PublishOutcome.acceptedByAny] and report
  /// [PublishOutcome.acceptedByAll] as breadth — which is what it measures.
  ///
  /// Cache writes follow the same rules as [publishEvent], except that the
  /// optimistic cache is rolled back when no relay accepted, and
  /// deletion-event cache cleanup only runs once something accepted.
  ///
  /// Ephemeral events (20000–29999) should use [publishEvent] because relays
  /// are not required to answer them with `OK`.
