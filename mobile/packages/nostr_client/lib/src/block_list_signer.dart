/// Consumed by repositories that publish on the user's behalf (e.g.
/// `ContentBlocklistRepository` for the NIP-51 kind 10000 mute list and the
/// legacy kind 30000 block list) and implemented at the app layer (e.g.
/// `AuthService`). Kept intentionally narrow — it only needs [Event] from
/// `nostr_sdk`, so neither the repository nor this contract depends on the
/// app's auth stack.
