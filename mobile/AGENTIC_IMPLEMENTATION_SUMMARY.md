# NostrVine Video Caching System - Agentic Implementation Summary

## Project Created

Successfully created a comprehensive plan for building a Cloudflare Workers-based video caching system optimized for 6-second vine videos with Nostr-driven discovery.

## GitHub Issues Created

### Phase 1: Core Video Delivery
- **#120** - Video Metadata API - Core video serving with signed URLs
- **#121** - ~~Smart Feed API~~ - Reconsidered due to Nostr architecture (commented with update)
- **#122** - Worker Router - API routing and CORS handling
- **#130** - ðŸ†• Batch Video Lookup API - Efficient bulk video metadata retrieval
- **#131** - ðŸ†• Client-Side Nostr Integration Guide - Video discovery from relay events

### Phase 2: Caching & Optimization
- **#123** - KV Metadata Store - Video metadata management system
- **#124** - R2 URL Signing - Secure video access with signed URLs
- **#125** - CDN Cache Optimization - Aggressive caching for short-form videos
- **#126** - ~~Prefetch Manager~~ - Updated to client-driven approach
- **#132** - ðŸ†• Client-Driven Prefetch Strategy - Based on Nostr event discovery

### Phase 3: Mobile Integration & Security
- **#127** - Flutter Video Service - Mobile-optimized short-form video consumption
- **#128** - Security & Rate Limiting - API protection and abuse prevention
- **#129** - Analytics & Monitoring - Performance tracking and observability

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- **#133** - End-to-End Testing - Nostr + Video API integration
- **#134** - Deployment & Feature Flags - Gradual rollout of video caching system
- **#135** - ðŸ“‹ Master Tracking Issue - Project overview and coordination

## Key Architectural Insights

### 1. Nostr-Driven Discovery
The critical realization that clients pull video events from Nostr relays (not server feeds) fundamentally changed our architecture:
- Eliminated complex feed pagination
- Focused on efficient batch lookups
- Moved prefetching logic client-side

### 2. Short-Form Video Optimization
6-second videos (1-10MB) allow dramatic simplification:
- No chunking needed
- Entire videos cached at edge
- Instant playback possible

### 3. Implementation Approach
Each GitHub issue includes:
- Complete context for agentic programming
- Specific commands (`wrangler`, `gh`)
- Code examples and implementation details
- Coordination notes for parallel development
- Testing requirements and acceptance criteria

## Files Created

1. **`cf-stream.md`** - Original comprehensive architecture plan
2. **`agentic-cf-stream-plan.md`** - Agentic programming implementation plan
3. **`AGENTIC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary

## Next Steps

Agents can now work on issues in parallel:
1. Backend team: Start with #120, #122, #130 (core APIs)
2. Frontend team: Review #131, start on #127 (mobile integration)
3. Infrastructure: Set up R2 buckets and KV namespaces
4. Testing: Prepare test data and environments

## Timeline

**Total Implementation Time**: 6 hours (reduced from 8 due to simplified architecture)
- Phase 1: 1.5 hours
- Phase 2: 2 hours
- Phase 3: 1.5 hours
- Phase 4: 1 hour

Ready for agentic implementation! ðŸš€
