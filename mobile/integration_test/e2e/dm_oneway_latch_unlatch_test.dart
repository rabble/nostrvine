// ABOUTME: E2E regression for #8519 — a thread latched to 'nip04' published a
// ABOUTME: cleartext kind 4 on every outbound message forever, even though the
// ABOUTME: send path had already resolved the peer's kind-10050 to `found`.
// ABOUTME: Asserts on the wire: what the relay was actually handed, not on a
// ABOUTME: mock. The two arms differ ONLY in the resolution state.
// ABOUTME: Requires: NO Docker stack — every dependency here is local.
