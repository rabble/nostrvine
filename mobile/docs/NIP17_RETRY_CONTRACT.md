# NIP-17 retry semantics: making a retry distinguishable from a repeat

Status: **proposal, awaiting a ruling from the `epic(dm)` #8227 owner.**
Tracking: [#6522](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-mobile/issues/6522)
Author's evidence: reproduced end-to-end, see "Evidence" below.

Nothing in this document is implemented. It exists so the protocol decision
#6522 asks for can be made against a written proposal rather than in a comment
thread. The code shipped alongside it only *hardens* and *observes* — it does
not change behaviour or the wire format.

## The problem in one paragraph

A NIP-17 receiver stores a message under its rumor id. If a sending client
retries delivery by **re-minting** the rumor — building a new kind-14 with a
fresh `created_at`, and therefore a fresh `id` — the receiver has no way to tell
that from the user deliberately sending the same text twice. Both arrive as two
distinct rumors with identical content from the same sender in the same room.
The receiver renders two bubbles for one logical message.

There is no receiver-side repair for this. The two cases are byte-identical in
every field the receiver can inspect, so no heuristic can separate them; it can
only pick which error to make. Divine already made that choice deliberately in
[#7324](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-mobile/issues/7324): suppressing
the second copy silently destroyed genuine repeated messages ("ok", "?", a
double-tapped send) with no error, no bubble and no recovery. Showing a
duplicate is the *less* harmful failure, and it is the current behaviour.

## Evidence

Reproduced on an iPhone 17 Simulator (iOS 26.5) against a local funnelcake
relay, with a hand-built NIP-59 peer that is not Divine:

- two gift wraps, byte-identical content, rumor `created_at` 30 s apart,
  distinct rumor ids, distinct wraps, distinct ephemeral wrap authors;
- both persisted into one conversation, no dedup gate logged a skip;
- the thread rendered two identical bubbles, and the message-request preamble
  counted them as separate messages ("they've sent 3 messages").

Confirmed against `nostr-protocol/nips` at HEAD: `kind 14` carries only `p`,
`e`, `subject` and `q`. No NIP defines a per-message correlation or idempotency
identifier, and none has been proposed.

## What Divine does today

Divine's sender **never re-mints.** Both recovery paths rebuild the rumor from
the stored `rumor_event_json` and republish it verbatim:

- `DmRepository.recoverFullSend` — retries a failed send
- `DmRepository.recoverSelfWrap` — replays the sender's cross-device copy

Both preserve `id` and `created_at`, so a receiver collapses the retry on its
rumor-id primary key. Every retry entry point routes through them — the
background sweep, the red-bubble "resend", the partial-delivery self-wrap
retry, and the inline reel-reply retry — and `outgoing_dm_retry_service.dart`
contains no rumor-building call at all.

Stated precisely: **Divine never re-mints a rumor it has stored.** Two paths do
mint a fresh rumor for the same text, and neither is a retry of a stored one:
`InlineReelReplyCubit.retry` falls back to a fresh `submit` when nothing was
parked (`inline_reel_reply_cubit.dart:192`), and `sendMessage` skips the
durable enqueue when no `outgoing_dms` DAO is wired. In both cases there is no
stored rumor and no wire copy in flight, so no duplicate can result. This is
now locked by
`dm_retry_rumor_identity_test.dart`; before that test it was protected only by
a doc comment, and a refactor that rebuilt the rumor through `buildRumor`
instead would have silently turned Divine into a source of this defect for
every peer it messages.

So Divine cannot cause this defect. It can only receive it.

## Proposal A (recommended): state the contract

NIP-17 already makes the rumor id the message's identity — it requires the
field:

> `.content` MUST be plain text. Fields `id` and `created_at` are required.

If the id is the identity, then minting a new id *is* creating a new message.
That is already the spec's model; it is simply never said out loud, so
implementers reasonably treat a retry as "send it again" rather than "put the
same event on the wire again."

**Proposed addition to NIP-17, after the Encrypting section:**

> When a client retries delivery of a message it has already attempted to send,
> it MUST re-wrap the original rumor — preserving its `id` and `created_at` —
> rather than construct a new one. A new `id` denotes a new message: receivers
> deduplicate on the rumor `id`, and a re-minted retry is indistinguishable
> from the user sending the same text twice. Only the seal and the gift wrap
> are rebuilt, which is required in any case since each carries a fresh
> ephemeral key and a fresh randomized `created_at`.

**Why this is the right shape**

- It costs nothing. No new tag, no new field, no format negotiation, no
  privacy surface, no migration.
- It makes the ambiguity impossible at the source instead of asking receivers
  to guess after the fact.
- It is compatible with every existing client that already re-wraps; it only
  names behaviour some already have.
- Divine is a conforming reference implementation, so we are asking the
  ecosystem to do what we already do rather than to adopt something we invented.

**What it does not do**

It does not help against a client that ignores it, and it has no effect until
clients adopt it. Adoption is outside our control. This is why B exists.

## Proposal B (fallback, specified but NOT implemented): a correlation tag

Only worth pursuing if A is rejected upstream, or if field evidence shows
re-minting is common enough that waiting on adoption is unacceptable.

**Divine already ships a tag in this exact position, and it is instructive that
it cannot be reused.** `sendMessage` and `sendGroupMessage` both inject
`['batch', <256-bit secure-random hex>]` into the rumor
(`dm_repository.dart:570`, minted at `:4184` / `:5861`, injected at `:4199` /
`:5887`), and the receive path parses it at `:2587`. Its own doc comment notes
that it "travels inside the encrypted rumor" and that "other clients ignore
unrecognised rumor tags, so it is inert on the wire" — so the extension point
is proven in production, not hypothetical.

Two properties stop it being the answer, and any correlation design has to
resolve both:

1. **Wrong polarity.** The token is minted once per *invocation*
   (`final sendBatchId = _newSendBatchId();`), and its documented purpose is
   "so two identical sends in the same Unix second produce distinct rumor ids."
   It is a **uniqueness nonce** — its job is to make two sends *differ*. Retry
   correlation needs the opposite: a token **stable across re-mints**. Because
   Divine replays the stored rumor on retry, the existing token has never been
   exercised as a correlator at all.
2. **Peer-authored tokens are deliberately refused, with a stated attack.**
   Ingest honours the tag only when `rumor.pubkey == ownerPubkey`
   (`dm_repository.dart:2588`), because — quoting the code — "accepting a
   peer-authored `'batch'` tag would let a sender suppress the local user's own
   in-flight group persist." Honouring a peer's token is precisely what #6522
   needs, so **any cross-client correlation contract must answer this
   suppression vector before it can ship.** This is the strongest argument for
   preferring A: a contract that says "reuse your own rumor" grants a peer no
   new power over the receiver's database, whereas any honoured peer-authored
   token does.

**Wire shape** — a tag inside the kind-14 rumor:

```json
["msgid", "<32 random bytes, hex>"]
```

- Generated once per **logical** message, at compose time.
- A retry re-uses the value. Two different messages MUST NOT share one.
- Random and opaque. It carries no derivation from the sender, the device, the
  session, the content, or any other message. It correlates a retry to its
  original and nothing else.

**Where it must live.** Inside the rumor, never on the seal or the gift wrap.
`59.md` is explicit that the outer layers exist to defeat exactly this kind of
linkage:

> When adding expiration tags to both `seal` and `gift wrap` layers,
> implementations SHOULD use independent random timestamps for each layer.
> Using different `created_at` values increases timing variance and helps
> protect against metadata correlation attacks.

A correlator on the wrap would be a relay-visible link between two events the
protocol works hard to keep unlinkable.

**Receiver semantics.** Claim-once, not existence. A logical message put on the
wire twice yields exactly one counterpart, so a stored row may absorb exactly
one arrival. `DirectMessagesDao.claimCrossProtocolTwin` is the existing
implementation of precisely this shape, including the single-statement
`UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (SELECT ... LIMIT 1)` that stops two concurrent
arrivals claiming the same row. Asking *existence* instead is what let one
stored row swallow every same-text arrival in
[#8211](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-mobile/issues/8211).

**Costs to weigh before adopting**

- The value is readable by every recipient of a group send, and persists in
  each of their local databases.
- It needs a Drift migration and changes the dedup contract currently pinned by
  `direct_messages_dao_test.dart`.
- It still only helps against clients that adopt it — the same adoption problem
  as A, but with a permanent format commitment attached.
- Group sends require one byte-identical rumor per send
  ([#8188](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-mobile/issues/8188)); the tag
  must be identical across recipients or it re-forks the id.

## Approaches that are already rejected

Recorded so they are not re-proposed.

| Approach | Why it is rejected |
|---|---|
| Widen the ±5s dedup window | Absorbs legitimate repeated messages and re-creates #7324's silent data loss. It also would not even reach this case: post-[#8169](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-mobile/issues/8169) the `DmDedupCounterpart` gate rejects a NIP-17-onto-NIP-17 match at *any* delta, so the window is not what decides here. |
| Content-hash dedup | Identical content is not evidence of the same send, and there is no safe time boundary. An unbounded rule permanently discards legitimate repeats. |
| Receiver-side heuristic suppression | Without a wire-level signal, any heuristic that catches a retry also discards a genuine repeat. It can only choose which error to make. |
| Anything keyed on the gift wrap's `created_at` | NIP-17 requires that timestamp to be randomized up to two days into the past. Measured in our repro at ~45 h from the rumor's own timestamp. It is deliberately noise. |

## Open question

**We do not know which third-party clients actually re-mint on retry.** No
spec-level prior art exists either way, and the send paths of Amethyst, 0xchat,
Coracle, NDK and rust-nostr were not read. This does not change which design is
correct, but it does change how urgent B is. It would be settled by reading
those retry paths, or by field evidence. The change shipped alongside this
document is what makes that evidence collectable: each `Persisted NIP-17 DM`
line now records `contentLength`, so two persist lines with the same
conversation, the same sender and the same length seconds apart are a re-mint
signature that support can grep out of a bug report. The plaintext is never
logged.

## Recommendation

Adopt A. Specify B and hold it. Do not ship any receiver-side suppression.

A is not merely cheaper than B — it is safer. B requires honouring a token
authored by the peer, which is the one thing the current ingest path refuses on
purpose (`dm_repository.dart:2588`); designing that safely is a larger problem
than the duplicate bubble it would fix. A grants the peer no new authority over
the receiver's database at all.
