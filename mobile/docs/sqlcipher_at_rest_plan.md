# SQLite3MultipleCiphers at-rest encryption for the local DB (#570, finding C2)

Status: **device-QA gated before merge.** The Dart implementation, dependency
swap, host tests, and local host probes are in this PR. The final gate is a real
iOS device and real Android device with a pre-existing encrypted database.

## Why

`divine_db.db` stores user data that includes drafts, pending uploads/actions,
reactions, reposts, notifications, bookmarks, NIP-05 state, and DMs. That file
must be encrypted at rest on native platforms. Web / IndexedDB remains out of
scope until the OPFS encryption work.

## Dependency shape

- `drift` is on the 2.34 line and `sqlite3` is on the 3.3 line.
- `sqlcipher_flutter_libs` is removed. The 0.7 line is an EOL no-op for sqlite3
  3.x, and the old Android `open.overrideFor` / SQLCipher workaround is gone.
- `sqlite3_flutter_libs` and `drift_flutter` must stay out of the app. Extra
  native SQLite providers can make plain SQLite win.
- `pubspec.yaml` selects SQLite3MultipleCiphers through the sqlite3 hook:

```yaml
hooks:
  user_defines:
    sqlite3:
      source: sqlite3mc
```

`package:sqlite3` 3.3.3 publishes prebuilt sqlite3mc assets for Android, iOS,
iOS simulator, macOS, Linux, Windows, and wasm. Local hook output confirmed the
workspace pubspec define is read and the host build loads `libsqlite3mc.dylib`.

## Key and open sequence

The app stores a 32-byte CSPRNG key in `flutter_secure_storage` under
`db.cipher.key.v1`, represented as 64 lower-case hex characters. db_client never
reads secure storage; the app bootstrap resolves the key and injects it.

Every keyed native open runs these statements before any database use:

```sql
PRAGMA cipher = 'sqlcipher';
PRAGMA legacy = 4;
PRAGMA key = "x'<64 hex chars>'";
```

The raw-key form skips PBKDF2, which is correct for a random 32-byte key and
preserves compatibility with databases previously written by SQLCipher. The key
must never appear in logs, exceptions, Crashlytics, analytics, or test output.

Fail-closed remains mandatory. The runtime and connection probes use
`PRAGMA cipher`; upstream SQLite returns no rows, while SQLite3MultipleCiphers
returns the active cipher. If MC is not active, startup refuses to open the local
database instead of silently writing plaintext.

## Plaintext-to-encrypted migration

`sqlcipher_export()` is not available under SQLite3MultipleCiphers, so the old
migration path is replaced with a safe side-file flow:

1. Classify the existing `divine_db.db` by opening it unkeyed. Only
   `SQLITE_NOTADB` is treated as already encrypted; transient read failures stay
   indeterminate and retry later.
2. For populated plaintext DBs, copy the source to
   `divine_db.db.sqlcipher_migrating` with `VACUUM INTO`.
3. Open the side file, select `cipher='sqlcipher'` + `legacy=4`, then
   `PRAGMA rekey = "x'<key>'"`.
4. Verify the encrypted copy opens with the raw key and that `user_version` plus
   all user-table row counts match the plaintext source.
5. Rename the plaintext source to a `.pre_cipher_migration_backup*` file and
   promote the verified encrypted artifact into place.

On any failure, the plaintext source is left intact and migration retries next
launch. After a later successful keyed open, old pre-cipher plaintext backups are
deleted so plaintext does not remain at rest.

## Key-loss recovery

If secure storage loses `db.cipher.key.v1` while an encrypted DB remains, the old
DB is cryptographically unrecoverable. The bootstrap backs up the unreadable DB
and creates a fresh encrypted DB under the new key. This is data-preserving in
the only possible way: the old bytes are retained for forensic/manual recovery,
but the app cannot unlock them without the lost key.

## Cache database

Only `divine_db.db` is keyed. `cache_sync.db` remains opened unkeyed. MC supports
plaintext databases, and the cache contains replaceable local cache state.

## Host verification

Host tests now cover the properties that used to be device-only:

- raw-key MC file-backed open succeeds with `cipher='sqlcipher'` + `legacy=4`;
- the encrypted file is not readable as plaintext SQLite;
- populated plaintext DB migration preserves `user_version` and row counts;
- malformed keys and keying failures do not leak the raw key;
- bootstrap key generation, reuse, key-loss backup, and fail-closed behavior.

Local probes also confirmed keyed in-memory MC databases are unsupported, so
tests use file-backed DBs.

## Device-QA checklist

- [ ] Real iOS device: existing SQLCipher-encrypted `divine_db.db` opens through
      the MC compatibility path with no data loss.
- [ ] Real Android device: existing SQLCipher-encrypted `divine_db.db` opens
      through the MC compatibility path with no data loss.
- [ ] Fresh iOS install creates an encrypted DB and plain `sqlite3` cannot read
      the file.
- [ ] Fresh Android install creates an encrypted DB and plain `sqlite3` cannot
      read the file.
- [ ] Legacy populated plaintext DB migrates once, preserves row counts and
      `user_version`, then removes pre-cipher plaintext backups after a keyed
      open.
- [ ] Force-kill during migration resumes without data loss.
- [ ] Clear secure storage / simulate key loss: app backs up the unreadable DB,
      creates a new encrypted DB, and does not brick.
- [ ] Key material is absent from logs, Crashlytics, analytics, and thrown error
      strings.

Record device, OS version, build number, and exact result for each item before
merging.
