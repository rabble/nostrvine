# Android Deployment Guide

Status: Launch-critical
Validated against: `mobile/build_android.sh`, `mobile/deploy_android.sh`, `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts`, and `mobile/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` on 2026-03-19.

This is the current Android release path for Divine.

## App Metadata

- App name: `Divine`
- Application ID: `co.openvine.app`
- Namespace: `co.openvine.app`
- Release artifact: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## Preferred Build Flow

From `mobile/`:

```bash
./build_android.sh release
```

What the script does:

1. Loads `.env` dart defines if present.
2. Auto-increments the build number for release builds.
3. Runs `flutter clean`, `flutter pub get`, and `build_runner`.
4. Builds a signed release AAB for Play Console upload.

## Upload Options

### Manual Play Console upload

1. Build the release AAB with `./build_android.sh release`.
2. Open Google Play Console.
3. Upload `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.
4. Add release notes and assign the correct testing or production track.

### Scripted upload helper

```bash
./deploy_android.sh internal
./deploy_android.sh closed
./deploy_android.sh production
```

The helper requires:

- `android/play-store-service-account.json`
- working Fastlane installation
- a previously built or buildable release AAB

#### Deploy Script Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--skip-build` | Skip the build step and upload an existing AAB |
| `--skip-upload` | Build only, do not upload to Play Console |
| `--version <version>` | Override the version name (e.g. `--version 1.0.7`) |
| `--notes <text>` | Set release notes for the upload (e.g. `--notes "Bug fixes"`) |

## Google Play Service Account Setup

To use the scripted upload helper, you need a Google Play service account:

1. Open [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) and navigate to **Settings > API access**.
2. Click **Create service account** and follow the link to Google Cloud Console.
3. In Google Cloud Console, create a new service account with a descriptive name (e.g. `divine-play-deploy`).
4. Back in Google Play Console, click **Grant access** on the new service account.
5. Assign the **Release manager** role so it can upload builds and manage releases.
6. On the service account row, create a new JSON key and download it.
7. Save the file as `android/play-store-service-account.json` inside the `mobile/` directory.

## Security Notes

- `android/play-store-service-account.json` is gitignored. **Never commit this file.**
- Store the JSON key securely (e.g. team password manager or encrypted CI secrets).
- Rotate the service account key periodically and revoke old keys after rotation.
- Limit service account permissions to only what is needed for deployment.

## Track Differences

| Track | Review Time | Tester Limit | Rollout Speed |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Internal | None (immediate) | Up to 100 internal testers | Instant |
| Closed | Typically < 24 hours | Up to 2,000 testers per group | Within hours of approval |
| Production | 1-7 days (first review may be longer) | Unlimited | Staged rollout (e.g. 5% → 20% → 100%) |

## Pre-Upload Checks

- Confirm `mobile/pubspec.yaml` version/build is correct.
- Confirm signing configuration and keystore access are available locally or in CI.
- Confirm release notes are ready.
- Confirm the manifest still removes Advertising ID and dependency-added location/Bluetooth permissions that are not used in this release.

## Manifest Notes For Store Compliance

Current Android manifest behavior:

- uses camera and microphone for recording
- uses media permissions for profile image and gallery interactions
- removes Advertising ID permission
- removes unused dependency-added Bluetooth, location, and nearby permissions
- registers deep links for `divine.video` and `login.divine.video`

## Troubleshooting

### Release build fails

- Run `flutter doctor`.
- Check keystore availability and `android/key.properties`.
- Re-run `flutter pub get` and `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.

### Upload helper fails

- Confirm `android/play-store-service-account.json` exists.
- Confirm Fastlane is installed and authenticated.
- Fall back to manual Play Console upload if needed.
