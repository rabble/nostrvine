// ABOUTME: Pins the framework contract behind #5839's belt-and-suspenders
// ABOUTME: pattern for ErrorWidget.builder / FlutterError.onError restores.
//
// The integration_test suites (mobile/integration_test) save ErrorWidget.builder
// and FlutterError.onError at the start of each test and restore them so an
// early `expect` failure cannot leak the override into a later test in the same
// file. #5839 made those restores exception-safe. The correct shape is
// ASYMMETRIC, and this test encodes why:
//
//   * ErrorWidget.builder MUST be restored INLINE before the body ends.
//     flutter_test's `_verifyErrorWidgetBuilderUnset` runs at end-of-body,
//     BEFORE any `addTearDown` callback, and fails the test with
//     "The value of ErrorWidget.builder was changed by the test." So an
//     addTearDown-only restore breaks the happy path. The integration tests
//     ALSO register an addTearDown restore (the "suspenders") so the throw
//     path is covered — addTearDown runs regardless of test outcome.
//   * FlutterError.onError may be restored via addTearDown ONLY, because the
//     binding resets it to its pre-test value in postTest() after every test.
//
// It is impossible to demonstrate the *failing* case (addTearDown-only builder
// restore) from a PASSING test: on the happy path the framework verify fails
// the test, and on the throw path the uncaught throw fails the test. That is
// exactly the constraint this pattern works around, so this file pins the
// POSITIVE contract instead. If a future refactor drops the inline
// ErrorWidget.builder restore, the first test below fails loudly.
