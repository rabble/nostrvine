# Fails CI if a new ChangeNotifier subclass — via `extends ChangeNotifier`
# or a `with ... ChangeNotifier` mixin clause — appears in mobile/lib/
# outside the sanctioned allowlist.
#
# Rule enforced:
#   * No `extends ChangeNotifier` and no `with ... ChangeNotifier` mixin
#     clause in mobile/lib/ outside the file allowlist below. Both forms
#     produce a ChangeNotifier, so a guard that matched only `extends`
#     would be trivially bypassable with the mixin syntax. Adding a new
#     sanctioned ChangeNotifier requires editing both this script's
#     ALLOWLIST and the "Sanctioned Riverpod (STAYS)" table in
#     docs/BLOC_UI_MIGRATION_PRD.md in the same PR.
#
# Scope:
#   * Only mobile/lib/ is scanned. mobile/packages/** is intentionally out
#     of scope — the standalone pub packages own their own architecture and
#     are not part of #4744's app-UI-state migration lane. This mirrors
#     check_riverpod_boundary.sh, which also scans mobile/lib/ only.
#
# Background:
#   Divine is mid-migration from Riverpod / ChangeNotifier to BLoC/Cubit for
#   UI state. The "Sanctioned Riverpod (STAYS)" section in
#   docs/BLOC_UI_MIGRATION_PRD.md enumerates the files that hold infrastructure
#   (DI / services / caches / router plumbing) and are out of scope for
#   #4744's Riverpod → BLoC lane. This guard prevents the carve-out from
#   silently regrowing — every new UI-state ChangeNotifier in mobile/lib/
#   must be migrated to a Cubit, not added here.
#
# Allowlist policy:
#   * Files in ALLOWLIST below must hold ZERO feature UI state — they own
#     infrastructure, a service, a cache, router plumbing, or preferences.
#   * Adding a file to ALLOWLIST is reviewed against that criterion and must
#     come with a matching docs table entry.
#
# Usage:
#   bash mobile/scripts/check_changenotifier_boundary.sh
#   (run from the repository root or from mobile/)

# Find every file under mobile/lib/ that declares a ChangeNotifier subclass —
# via `extends ChangeNotifier` or a `with ... ChangeNotifier` mixin clause —
# excluding generated files and build artifacts. Then filter out allowlisted
# entries. Anything that survives is a violation.
#
# Matcher notes:
#   * The trailing `\b` keeps `ChangeNotifierProvider` / `ChangeNotifierX`
#     from matching — only the bare `ChangeNotifier` type counts.
#   * The `with [..]*ChangeNotifier` branch catches the mixin form in any
#     slot (`with ChangeNotifier`, `with Foo, ChangeNotifier`). Anchoring on
#     the `with ` keyword (vs. a bare `, ChangeNotifier`) keeps parameter /
#     field declarations of type ChangeNotifier from tripping the guard.
