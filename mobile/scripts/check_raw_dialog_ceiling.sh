# Raw-dialog ceiling ratchet (#6145, epic #4339): every Dart file under mobile/lib
# that calls a raw dialog/sheet helper (`showDialog(`, `showModalBottomSheet(`, …)
# or constructs the modal Route behind one (`DialogRoute<T>(`, …) is frozen at its
# current count in scripts/baseline/raw_dialogs.txt, a per-file CEILING that may
# only ever DECREASE. New surfaces should prefer a full-screen flow, or the
# VineBottomSheet family from divine_ui, rather than a raw dialog/sheet (rule:
# ui_theming.md / AGENTS.md → "Prefer full-screen flows over new dialogs/sheets").
#
# Detector (occurrences, in code only — see lib/dart_code_only.awk):
#   \b(showDialog|showModalBottomSheet|showGeneralDialog|showBottomSheet
#     |showCupertinoDialog|showCupertinoModalPopup|showAdaptiveDialog
#     |DialogRoute|RawDialogRoute|ModalBottomSheetRoute)[[:space:]]*[(<]
# The imperative `show*` helpers and the modal Route classes they build on are both
# counted: pushing a `DialogRoute<void>(...)` onto the navigator is the same drift
# as calling showDialog, and was previously invisible to this guard.
#
# The trailing `[(<]` (rather than a bare `\(`) is deliberate: these are generic and
# are usually called with an explicit type argument — showDialog<bool>(,
# showModalBottomSheet<void>(, DialogRoute<void>(, nested/multi-line generics — that
# a `...\(` regex would miss (and a dev could add a type arg to bypass). Requiring a
# call/generic opener also keeps a bare mention in a log message or an identifier
# from counting. Word boundaries exclude wrapper NAMES (showForgotPasswordDialog,
# _showDialog, showVideoPausingVineBottomSheet); a wrapper's body still calls the raw
# token once, counted once (correct). Dartdoc refs like `/// [showModalBottomSheet]`
# are dropped by the comment filter. VineBottomSheet (the sanctioned sheet) lives in
# divine_ui, a separate package, so VineBottomSheet.show(...) callers are out of
# scope by construction. showLicensePage is deliberately NOT counted: it pushes a
# full-screen MaterialPageRoute, which is the outcome this ratchet steers toward.
#
# Per-key NUMERIC ceiling: a file may drop calls freely while above zero without
# churning the baseline; only growth / new file / raised ceiling / drop-to-zero
# (STALE) fails. Generated code excluded by path (l10n/generated) and suffix.
#
# Regenerate after MIGRATING to a full-screen flow / VineBottomSheet (never to raise):
#   UPDATE_BASELINE=1 bash mobile/scripts/check_raw_dialog_ceiling.sh
# Run (from repo root or mobile/): bash mobile/scripts/check_raw_dialog_ceiling.sh
