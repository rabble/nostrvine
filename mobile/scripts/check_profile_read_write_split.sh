# Profile read/write split invariant (#6423).
#
# profileReadRepositoryProvider hands over a ProfileReader at the
# identity-known phase — before the signer-backed NostrClient exists. That is
# safe for Drift reads and unsafe for signing, so no file may reach a profile
# publish through the loose provider.
#
# The ProfileReader type already makes the DIRECT route impossible: it cannot
# express saveProfileEvent / claimUsername / releaseUsername / drivePendingSave.
# This guard covers the INDIRECT route a type cannot see — a file that reads
# the loose provider and separately calls a publish method on something else
# (a repository it also holds, a service, a bloc field).
#
# Detector (code only — comments and string literals are stripped first by
# lib/dart_code_only.awk, so a doc comment naming saveProfileEvent never trips
# it): files under mobile/lib mentioning profileReadRepositoryProvider are
# intersected with files calling a publish method.
#
# There is no baseline: the correct count is zero, always. If this fires, move
# the publish to profileRepositoryProvider (which stays gated on
# isReadyForActiveClient) rather than widening ProfileReader.
#
# Usage (from the repo root or mobile/):
#   bash mobile/scripts/check_profile_read_write_split.sh

A file that reads profileReadRepositoryProvider also publishes a profile.

That provider resolves at the identity-known phase, which carries a pubkey but
no signer-backed client, so a publish reached from there can be signed by the
wrong key or not at all (#1048, #6423).

Fix: take the publish dependency from profileRepositoryProvider instead — it
stays gated on isReadyForActiveClient. Do NOT widen ProfileReader to make the
call compile.
