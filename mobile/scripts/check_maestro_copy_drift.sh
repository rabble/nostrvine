# Maestro copy-drift guard: every English string the Maestro suite asserts or
# taps is bound to the ARB key it came from in
# scripts/baseline/maestro_copy_manifest.txt, and this check fails when the
# current value of that key in lib/l10n/app_en.arb no longer appears in the
# bound flow file. Between 2026-03 and 2026-08 the suite silently rotted
# because copy changes and flow changes live in different files with nothing
# failing when they diverged; this is the failure that should have fired.
#
# app_en.arb is the ONLY source of truth for English copy. Two failure modes:
#   DRIFT        — a bound ARB key's current value is absent from the bound
#                  flow file (copy changed under the suite, or the flow edited
#                  without regenerating). The message names the key, the flow
#                  file, and the current ARB value to adopt.
#   UNREGISTERED — a flow literal exactly matches a non-parameterized ARB
#                  value but has no manifest binding (new assertion added
#                  without registering). Regenerate to register it.
#
# Manifest format (one binding per line, '#'-comments allowed):
#   <arb_key><TAB><flow path relative to mobile/>[<TAB>bound:<literal>]
#   <arb_key><TAB><flow path relative to mobile/><TAB>rendered:<literal>]
# The 'bound:' third column records the literal the flow asserted when the row
# was auto-derived; it exists so that regeneration and the base-ref ratchet can
# excuse ONLY removals where the flow genuinely stopped asserting that copy —
# renaming an ARB key does not excuse a vanished binding while its literal is
# still asserted. 'rendered:' rows are for PARAMETERIZED ARB values (ICU
# placeholders like {count}): flows assert the rendered string, not the
# template, so the rendered literal is recorded by hand and checked verbatim
# against the flow AND against the template (every literal segment of the
# template must still appear in it, in order). Rendered entries survive
# regeneration; everything else is auto-derived.
#
# Element ids (id: ...) are NOT copy and are out of scope by design; regex
# selectors (e.g. "Search.*") never exactly equal an ARB value and so never
# bind — that is conservative on purpose, not a gap to close with fuzzy
# matching.
#
# Known v1 limits are tracked in #7213: this guard only binds literals that
# already match app_en.arb, so already-drifted flow copy remains invisible; it
# also checks by substring against the extracted file text, so copy shortening
# can pass until the planned exact-literal inverse check lands.
#
# Regenerate after an intentional copy change (review the printed diff of
# added/removed bindings — regeneration re-blesses whatever ARB says today):
#   UPDATE_BASELINE=1 bash mobile/scripts/check_maestro_copy_drift.sh
# Regeneration REFUSES to drop a binding while the flow still asserts its
# recorded literal — a renamed or deleted ARB key does NOT excuse the removal.
# If the flow genuinely stopped asserting that copy, say so explicitly:
#   ACCEPT_REMOVALS=1 UPDATE_BASELINE=1 bash ...
# The check also ratchets against the base ref (MAESTRO_COPY_DRIFT_BASE_REF,
# default origin/main): a binding present on the base manifest may not vanish
# from the branch manifest while its literal is still asserted — that closes
# the bypass where a PR regenerates away its own regression. Bootstrap:
# skipped with a note until the manifest lands on the base ref. Fails closed
# when the base is unloadable; MAESTRO_COPY_DRIFT_ALLOW_NO_BASE=1 is the
# local-only opt-out.
# Usage (from the repo root or mobile/): bash mobile/scripts/check_maestro_copy_drift.sh
