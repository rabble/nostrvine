# Fails CI if a test the very_good optimizer MERGES into the shared isolate
# assigns HttpOverrides.global. That removes flutter_test's HTTP 400-mock for
# every later merged test, letting a real network call leak a connect-timer that
# surfaces as an order-dependent "Pending timers" failure cross-attributed to an
# unrelated widget test (PR #5163, #3137).
#
# A file is in the merge UNLESS it is tagged @Tags(['skip_very_good_optimization']).
# Being under test/manual/ does NOT exclude it — only the tag does (the very_good
# --optimization globber does not honor dart_test.yaml's exclude: test/manual/**).
#
# Policy: STRICT. No merged (untagged) test may assign HttpOverrides.global at
# all. A test that legitimately needs real network must be tagged
# skip_very_good_optimization (+ integration) so it stays out of the merge. A
# within-file restore is NOT accepted: grep cannot prove a restore is reachable,
# and even a correct tearDownAll restore still leaves the global nulled while the
# file runs inside the shared isolate.
#
# Reads (HttpOverrides.current) and local VineCdnHttpOverrides(...).lookup() do
# not match — only assignment to `.global` is flagged. lib/ is out of scope (the
# production VineCdnHttpOverrides install in lib/main.dart is not a test).

# Usage:
#   bash mobile/scripts/check_http_overrides_isolation.sh
