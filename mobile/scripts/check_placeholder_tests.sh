# Placeholder-test ratchet (#3340): tests that pass no matter what the product
# does, and test files that declare no test at all, are frozen at ZERO per file
# in scripts/baseline/placeholder_tests.txt. The baseline is intentionally
# EMPTY — #3340 removed all 93 sites — so any entry here is a regression.
#
# Why: .claude/rules/testing.md — "A passing test should be evidence that the
# feature works. If the test would still pass with the feature broken, it tests
# nothing." Coverage theatre is worse than an uncovered line, because the green
# line hides the gap instead of flagging it. The 93 sites removed by #3340
# included a 602-line accessibility suite whose 38 tests were all
# `expect(true, isTrue)`, and seven ProofMode suites waiting on services that
# were deliberately deleted a year earlier.
#
# Two rules, both frozen at zero:
#   1. TAUTOLOGY      — every assertion in the test is trivially satisfied
#                       (`expect(true, isTrue)`, `expect(1, 1)`).
#   2. NO DECLARATIONS — a *_test.dart that declares no test / testWidgets /
#                       blocTest / patrolTest / group. A `main()` that only
#                       forwards (`void main() => platform.main();`) is exempt:
#                       that is the conditional-import dispatcher shape, whose
#                       declarations live in the platform library it selects.
#
# A test with NO assertion is deliberately NOT counted. Assertions arrive
# through drift's `verifier.migrateAndValidate`, through imported helpers like
# `expectMeetsAccessibilityGuidelines`, and through matchers this parser cannot
# resolve across files. Counting them would put ~20 good tests on a debt list,
# and a guard that cries wolf gets switched off. That population is real and
# needs helper-aware triage, not a gate.
#
# There is no escape hatch. A construction smoke test can assert
# `expect(() => Foo(), returnsNormally)` or `expect(foo, isNotNull)`; a widget
# lifecycle test can assert `expect(tester.takeException(), isNull)`. If a
# genuine exception ever appears, it earns a reviewed baseline entry — not a
# self-service inline ignore.
#
# Detector: scripts/lib/placeholder_test_detector.dart (a real Dart AST).
# A grep cannot do this: `dart format` spells `expect(true, isTrue)` on one line
# or four depending on surroundings — a line scan found 14 of the 38 tautologies
# in test/widget/tdd/accessibility_ui_test.dart — and the question is whether
# the tautology is the test's ONLY assertion, which is a property of the body,
# not of a line. Pinned by test/tools/placeholder_test_detector_test.dart.
#
# Regenerate ONLY after an intentional, reviewed change:
#   UPDATE_BASELINE=1 bash mobile/scripts/check_placeholder_tests.sh
# Run (from repo root or mobile/): bash mobile/scripts/check_placeholder_tests.sh
# List the individual sites:
#   dart run scripts/lib/placeholder_test_detector.dart test integration_test packages --path-prefix . --detail

Assert the behaviour instead of expect(true, isTrue): expect(() => Foo(), returnsNormally) for construction, expect(tester.takeException(), isNull) for a lifecycle pump, or a real matcher on the result.
