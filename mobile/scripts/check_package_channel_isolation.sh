# Per-package merged-isolate channel-handler ratchet (#5838). Each package under
# mobile/packages runs its OWN fully-merged `very_good test --optimization`
# bundle (the reusable flutter_package.yml@v1 defaults test_optimization: true),
# and — unlike mobile/test — NO package has a flutter_test_config.dart
# heal-and-blame harness. So a package test that installs a MethodChannel /
# EventChannel mock handler WITHOUT tearing it back down leaks that handler into
# every later file in the same package's bundle, an order-dependent flake
# confined to that package's suite.
#
# This freezes the set of package *_test.dart ENTRIES that install a channel
# handler (setMockMethodCallHandler / setMockStreamHandler) but never null one
# back down. The set may only ever SHRINK: a NEW such entry fails CI. This is the
# packages analogue of check_shared_channel_overrides.sh (#5738), which guards
# the mobile/test tree only. See lib/list_ratchet.sh for NEW/STALE/GROWTH
# semantics and .claude/rules/testing.md (VGV merged isolate).
#
# Detector (grep proxy): a *_test.dart under mobile/packages/*/test that calls
# setMockMethodCallHandler( / setMockStreamHandler( AND does NOT pair any install
# with a `(..., null)` teardown, and is NOT tagged @Tags(['skip_very_good_optimization'])
# (tagged files run in their own isolate). Non-*_test.dart helpers
# (test_setup.dart, **/helpers/*.dart) are not bundle entries and are excluded by
# the --include filter — they install suite-wide mocks by design, exactly like
# mobile/test/test_setup.dart. Being a grep proxy it cannot prove the teardown is
# reachable or nulls the SAME channel; the canonical fix is to null the handler
# in tearDown, and the tag is the escape hatch for a test that legitimately
# cannot restore.
#
# Regenerate ONLY after REMOVING an install (never to add one):
#   UPDATE_BASELINE=1 bash mobile/scripts/check_package_channel_isolation.sh
# Usage (from the repo root or mobile/):
#   bash mobile/scripts/check_package_channel_isolation.sh

STALE_HINT="A package test stopped leaking a channel handler (added a null teardown or a skip tag)."
FOOTER="Package channel installs without a teardown are frozen and may only decrease.
Null every installed handler in tearDown so it does not leak across the package's
merged isolate. Singletons are guarded separately (#6060 / follow-up); the runtime
per-package heal-and-blame harness remains a stronger future option (#5838 notes).
See mobile/scripts/check_shared_channel_overrides.sh (mobile/test analogue) and #5838."
