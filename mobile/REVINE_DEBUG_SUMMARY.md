# Revine Display Issue - Debug Summary & Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue**: Users could revine (repost) videos in the feed, but revined videos were not appearing in their profile's "Revines" tab.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue had **two main causes**:

### 1. **VideoEventService Disabled Reposts by Default**
- `VideoEventService.subscribeToVideoFeed()` had `includeReposts: false` as default
- Even when `includeReposts: true` was passed, there was an early return that skipped ALL Kind 6 (repost) events:

```dart
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
if (event.kind == 6) {
  Log.warning('⏩ Skipping repost event... (reposts disabled by default)');
  return; // This ALWAYS skipped reposts!
}
```

### 2. **Profile Screen Didn't Enable Reposts**
- Profile screen called `videoEventService.refreshVideoFeed()` without enabling reposts
- The reposts tab relied on VideoEventService having repost events, but they were filtered out

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed VideoEventService Repost Handling**

**Added state tracking**:
```dart
// Track if reposts are enabled for current subscription
bool _includeReposts = false;
```

**Fixed the filtering logic**:
```dart
// OLD - Always skipped:
if (event.kind == 6) { return; }

// NEW - Only skip if disabled:
if (event.kind == 6 && !_includeReposts) { return; }
```

**Updated subscription method**:
```dart
_includeReposts = includeReposts;
Log.debug('Include reposts: $_includeReposts');
```

### 2. **Updated Profile Screen to Enable Reposts**

**Changed profile initialization**:
```dart
// OLD:
videoEventService.refreshVideoFeed();

// NEW:
videoEventService.subscribeToVideoFeed(includeReposts: true);
```

**Updated refresh method to preserve setting**:
```dart
return subscribeToVideoFeed(includeReposts: _includeReposts);
```

## ✅ How It Works Now

### The Complete Revine Flow:

1. **User clicks revine button** → `SocialService.repostEvent()` creates Kind 6 event
2. **VideoEventService processes Kind 6** → Creates `VideoEvent` with `isRepost: true`  
3. **Profile tab filters correctly** → Shows videos where `video.isRepost && video.reposterPubkey == userPubkey`
4. **Revined videos appear in profile** → User can see their revines in the dedicated tab

### Key Data Structure:

```dart
// Revined video maintains original content but tracks reposter
VideoEvent revineEvent = VideoEvent.createRepostEvent(
  originalEvent: originalVideo,    // All original content preserved
  repostEventId: 'kind6_event_id', // The repost event ID
  reposterPubkey: userPubkey,      // Who revined it
  repostedAt: DateTime.now(),      // When it was revined
);

// Results in:
revineEvent.isRepost = true                    // ✅ Flags it as repost
revineEvent.reposterPubkey = userPubkey        // ✅ Profile filter catches this
revineEvent.videoUrl = originalVideo.videoUrl // ✅ Video still playable
revineEvent.pubkey = originalAuthor            // ✅ Credits original author
```

## 🧪 Tests Created

1. **`test/revine_profile_display_test.dart`** - Basic filtering logic tests
2. **`test/revine_fix_test.dart`** - VideoEvent creation and structure tests  
3. **`test/integration/revine_end_to_end_test.dart`** - Complete flow verification

## 📱 User Experience Impact

**Before Fix**:
- ❌ User revines video → Nothing appears in profile
- ❌ Confusing experience - "Did my revine work?"
- ❌ Profile revines tab always empty

**After Fix**:
- ✅ User revines video → Immediately appears in profile revines tab
- ✅ Clear feedback that revine worked
- ✅ User can see complete history of their revined content
- ✅ Videos remain playable and properly attributed

## 🎯 Additional Benefits

- **Performance**: Only loads reposts when specifically needed (profile view)
- **Accuracy**: Proper filtering ensures only user's own revines appear
- **Consistency**: Terminology aligned (app calls it "revine", code handles "repost")
- **Reliability**: Edge cases handled (missing metadata, duplicate revines, etc.)

## 🔮 Future Considerations

1. **UI Terminology**: Consider updating code comments to use "revine" terminology
2. **Performance**: Monitor impact of loading reposts in profile view
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensure other social features (likes, follows) work similarly
4. **Analytics**: Track revine engagement now that it's properly displayed

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Revines now appear correctly in user profiles
