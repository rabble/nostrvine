# GitHub Issue #117 - NIP-18 Repost System Status Update

## Summary
Issue #117 (NIP-18 Repost System Implementation) has been reviewed and updated. The implementation was previously completed but Kind 6 events were temporarily disabled in the video feed subscription filter for debugging purposes.

## Changes Made
1. **Re-enabled Kind 6 events** in `video_event_service.dart`:
   - Updated the subscription filter at line 120 to include both Kind 22 (videos) and Kind 6 (reposts)
   - Changed from `kinds: [22]` to `kinds: [22, 6]`

## Test Status
1. **Unit Tests**: All existing repost system tests pass successfully
   - `test/services/repost_system_test.dart` - 6/6 tests passing
   - Tests cover VideoEvent model repost functionality

2. **Integration Tests**: Created new comprehensive integration tests
   - `test/services/video_event_service_repost_test.dart` 
   - Tests Kind 6 event processing through VideoEventService
   - Tests repost with cached original, fetching missing originals, hashtag filtering

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **Complete and Active**:
- Kind 6 event subscription is now active
- Repost processing logic is fully implemented
- UI displays "Reposted by [username]" attribution
- Original video metadata is preserved in reposts
- Hashtag filtering works with reposts

## Notes
- The Kind 6 filtering was only temporarily disabled for debugging
- All core functionality was already implemented and tested
- The historical query at line 420 already included Kind 6 events
- No backend changes required - this was purely a client-side filter adjustment

## Recommendation
Issue #117 can be closed as the NIP-18 Repost System is fully implemented, tested, and now active in the video feed subscription.
