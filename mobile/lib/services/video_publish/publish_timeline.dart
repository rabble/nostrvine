///   recovery sweep kicked off. Those legs belong to whichever chain started
///   them, so attributing them to the publish that happened to wait would be
///   the wrong answer, not a missing one.
/// - `VideoEventPublisher` (`nostr.sign`, `nostr.publish`, `nostr.blurhash`) —
///   always inside the zone; `publishVideoEvent` is awaited directly by
///   `VideoPublishService`.
///
/// A `Timer`, an isolate hop, or a future scheduled outside `run` would drop
/// the metric the same silent way. There is deliberately no assert for it:
/// the joined-upload case above is legitimate and would trip on every resumed
/// publish. `upload_ms` still covers the leg, so the console shows a duration
