  /// Returns `true` only when a HEAD request to [videoUrl] returns a hard
  /// 404. Every other status — including 401 and 403 — and any network failure
  /// return `false`, so the caller must treat the failure as transient and keep
  /// the video in place.
  ///
  /// **401 must never widen this predicate.** Divine's media host returns 401,
  /// not 404, for an age-restricted blob, and grants access as soon as the
  /// request carries a pubkey — blossom's `access_for` maps `AgeRestricted` to
  /// `AgeGated` gated on `requester_pubkey.is_some()`, not on the viewer's age.
  /// An anonymous HEAD therefore cannot tell whether a 401 item is playable,
  /// and callers of this predicate persist their answer via
  /// `BrokenVideoTracker`, so treating a 401 as missing would hide a video the
  /// viewer is entitled to watch for the tracker's full TTL, on every surface
  /// that consults it. Measured at 8.0% of `classic=true` blobs (n=600) — a
  /// larger class than the 5.5% that 404. See #5953 / #6251.
  ///
  /// Note that `true` means "not retrievable *now*", not "the bytes are gone":
  /// blossom collapses `Banned`, `Deleted`, `Restricted` *and* genuinely-absent
  /// metadata into 404, and `Restricted` is reversible by a moderator. A 404
  /// alone therefore does not justify a persistent prune — see
  /// `DeadMediaFeedGuard`, which also requires a terminal moderation verdict.
  ///
  /// When no [client] is injected a throwaway [http.Client] is created and
  /// closed after the request.
