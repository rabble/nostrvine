/// so rows converge during an uninterrupted foreground session too; and
/// [DmRepository.retryableOutgoingWork] nudges whenever a send or recovery
/// leaves a retryable row behind, which BOOTSTRAPS that follow-up timer —
/// without it a soft-unconfirmed send after a cold start sat pending until
/// the next foreground flip or connectivity change.
///
/// **Re-entrancy:** a sweep already in progress short-circuits the
/// next trigger; the deferred work is picked up on the next trigger.
///
/// **Per-row backoff:** rows whose `lastAttemptAt + backoff(retryCount)`
/// is in the future are skipped this pass. `incrementRetry` is called
/// only on a real publish failure so transient repo-not-ready states
/// don't burn the retry budget.
///
/// **Scope:** three sweep arms run on each trigger:
///
/// 1. `recipient: sent / self: failed` → [DmRepository.recoverSelfWrap]
///    (the canonical partial-delivery recovery from #4124).
/// 2. `recipient: failed` → [DmRepository.recoverFullSend] (replays both
///    wraps; rumor.id is stable across retries so NIP-17 receiver dedup
///    drops the duplicate copy if the original publish actually landed).
/// 3. Either wrap still `pending` and the row queuedAt is older than the
///    interrupted-send threshold → [DmRepository.recoverFullSend]. This
///    catches both app-killed mid-send rows (epic #3912's "outgoing DM
///    survives the app being killed mid-send") and soft-unconfirmed sends
///    (recipient frame written, no NIP-20 OK yet), both surfaced by
///    [OutgoingDmsDao.getStillPendingForOwner]. The min-age guard avoids
///    racing with a `sendMessage` still in flight in the same process;
///    idempotency at the receiver makes the race safe even if it fires false.
///    A pending row that has burned the retry budget (`retry_count >=
///    maxRetries`) is terminalized to `failed` here, since
///    `getStillPendingForOwner` — unlike the failed arm's
///    `getRetryableForOwner` — has no retry-count cap of its own.
