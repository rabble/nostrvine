/// Two failure modes leave a user staring at an empty library while the
/// recordings are still on the device, and this service addresses both:
///
/// * **Rows under another owner.** Every drafts/clips query filters by
///   `ownerPubkey`, so a session that resolved to a different account — or a
///   recording stamped before a session had resolved at all — is invisible
///   rather than gone. [scanRecoverableClips] reports those groups and
///   [claimOwnerGroup] restamps one to the signed-in account.
/// * **Rows gone, files left.** A database reset drops every clip row while
///   the mp4s stay in the documents directory. [scanRecoverableClips] lists
///   the unreferenced files and [importOrphanFiles] rebuilds library rows for
///   them.
///
/// Both are developer-tool operations: they write, and the owner restamp in
/// particular hands another account's rows to the current one. The caller is
/// expected to show the scan before offering either.
