/// Persists the user's preference for only showing capture-verified videos.

/// This is the provenance axis, and it is deliberately separate from
/// [DivineHostFilterService]'s hosting axis. Where a video is served from
/// says who can moderate or take it down; whether it carries a capture
/// chain (C2PA / ProofMode) says whether it can be traced back to a camera.
/// A creator can publish verified media on their own host, and unverified
/// media can sit on ours, so neither answers the other's question.
///
/// Defaults to `false`. Enabling it by default would hide every upload
/// without a capture chain from users who never chose it — roughly an
/// eighth of modern uploads at the time of writing.
///
/// Archive content is exempt at the filter site, not here: original Vine
/// videos predate content credentials by a decade and can never satisfy a
/// provenance check.
