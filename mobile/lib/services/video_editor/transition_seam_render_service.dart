/// already-rendered transition seams. Each clip plays only its body (minus the
/// tail/head consumed by adjacent rendered seams), with the seam clip inserted
/// between neighbours. Transitions whose seam is not rendered yet simply play
/// as a hard cut until the seam arrives.
///
/// Transitions are taken from [clampTransitions] so the
/// preview consumes exactly what the export will, and a clip touched by
/// transitions on both sides is split between them rather than replayed.
///
/// When [speedRenders] is provided, a clip that runs at a non-1× speed and is
/// **not** consumed by an adjacent seam plays its pre-rendered normal-rate file
/// (speed baked in) at 1× instead of retiming live — smoother on both
/// platforms. Until that render lands (or for a seam-consumed clip) it falls
/// back to live per-clip retiming, so playback is never blocked on a render.
