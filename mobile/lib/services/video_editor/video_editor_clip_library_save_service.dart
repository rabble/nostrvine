/// Service for saving a single timeline clip to the persistent clip library.
class VideoEditorClipLibrarySaveService {
  /// Renders [clip]'s trim window into a standalone file and returns it as a
  /// fresh [DivineVideoClip] ready to hand to the clip library.
  ///
  /// Unlike the editor's own trim-based split (which keeps both halves on the
  /// shared source file), a library clip must outlive the editing session that
  /// produced it and be insertable into an unrelated project. So this re-encodes
  /// rather than carrying a trim window: the output holds *only* the selected
  /// section, and the returned clip carries no residual trim/speed/volume — the
  /// [VideoEditorRenderService.renderVideo] pipeline bakes all three in. That is
  /// what lets the user reuse a moment from a long video without dragging the
  /// whole source along (#5322).
  ///
  /// `reversed` is deliberately dropped rather than copied: a reversed clip's
  /// `video` already points at reversed content, so the flattened file is
  /// reversed too and re-flagging it would double-apply on the next render.
  ///
  /// The render is uncapped (`maxOutputDuration: null`) because a library clip
  /// is an intermediate clip the user can still trim, not a final export — the
  /// same reasoning as `VideoEditorMergeService.mergeClips`.
  ///
  /// [overlays] are the layers/filters/tune/blur that were over *this clip*,
  /// already windowed and rebased to start at zero by
  /// [EditorOverlaySnapshot.windowedTo]. They get baked into the output too, so
  /// the saved clip looks the way it looked on the timeline. Pass `null` (or an
  /// empty snapshot) to render the bare video. Only *visual* overlays are baked
  /// — session audio (background music, voice-over) spans the whole project
  /// timeline and is deliberately not carried onto a single saved clip.
  ///
  /// [renderId] keys the native progress/cancel stream.
  ///
  /// Returns `null` when the render is cancelled or fails — both already
  /// surface as a `null` output path from [VideoEditorRenderService.renderVideo].
  /// The returned clip's file lives in the persistent documents dir; if the
  /// caller does not go on to store it in the library, it must call
  /// [cleanupFlattenedClip] to avoid leaving an orphan there.
