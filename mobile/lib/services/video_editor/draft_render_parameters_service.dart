/// `audioTracks`. Rendering from the restored map alone therefore produces a
/// video with none of the overlays the user authored: no text, stickers or
/// drawings, no timed filters or tune adjustments, and no added music.
///
/// Everything needed to rebuild them survives elsewhere in the draft —
/// `editorStateHistory` keeps the layers, filters and tune, the audio timeline
/// lives in the parameters' own `meta`, and a recorder-picked sound sits on the
/// draft itself. Only the *rasterized* layer bytes are unrecoverable from
/// storage, which is what [LayerRasterizer] regenerates by briefly mounting the
