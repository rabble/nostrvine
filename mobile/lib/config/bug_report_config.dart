/// half-redacted with the jwt still beside the marker, and no depth-limited
/// pattern fixes that for arbitrary nesting. Redacting a sibling field on the
/// same line is the cheap direction of that trade. The same-line branch is
/// tried first; the branch behind it also crosses newlines, which is what
/// catches a pretty-printed value.
///
/// Both are bounded at 4000 characters, and the bound does two jobs. It caps
/// what an unclosed `{` can consume: 4000 characters of surrounding
/// diagnostics, rather than everything up to `maxLogSummaryLength`. In a short
/// report that cap is still most of it - the bound limits the damage, it does
/// not make a stray brace cheap.
/// It also keeps the scan linear: without it, every `token: {` candidate on a
/// long line rescans to the end of that line, which is quadratic in the size
/// of a pasted field. 4000 is chosen to sit above the things being bounded -
/// a JWT runs 300-800 characters on its own, and `bug_report_service.dart`
/// pretty-prints device info - because below the bound is where redaction is
/// whole and above it is where a secret survives beside the marker.
///
/// Both quoted branches require the closing quote and stop at a newline, so an
/// unbalanced quote (`password: "oops` typed into a bug report) falls through
/// to the unquoted branch and costs one word, rather than swallowing every
/// field printed after it. The optional `bearer`/`basic`/`token` scheme word

/// account name and leaving the filename beside a `[REDACTED]` marker would be

/// whitespace or delimiter so it does not swallow the surrounding log line.

/// The lowercase `/home/` branch requires the account name to be followed by a
/// further separator, so a real path (`/home/<name>/<file>`) matches while the
/// terminal `/home/<index>` video-feed route (`RoutePaths.videoFeedForIndex`)
/// does not; that separator is a correctness device, not a performance one.
/// `/Users` (macOS/Windows) and `/Volumes` (external drives) collide with no
/// route, so they need no such guard and also redact a bare `/Users/<name>`;
/// the app-sandbox roots collide with no route either.
///
/// URLs, GoRouter routes, and `package:` / `dart:` references carry no account
/// name and are triage-critical, so they are left intact - with one safe
/// exception: the root is unanchored, so a URL whose *path* contains a covered
/// segment (a capital `/Users/`, `/home/<seg>/`, `/Volumes/`, or a sandbox
/// root) is over-redacted from that segment on. That is over-redaction, never a
/// leak, and it does not touch Divine's own triage URLs - content-addressed
/// media, host-only relay, and the terminal `/home/<index>` route all survive,
/// and the match is case-sensitive so lowercase web routes like `/users/` are
/// untouched. URL secrets (userinfo, `?token=`) are handled by the credential
/// rules above and by `redactUriStringForLogs` at the structured log sites.
///
/// Linearity comes from the bounds: every segment is a single character class
/// with a `{1,255}` or `{0,4000}` cap and no nested quantifier, so matching

    //
    // Credential key/value pairs. Keys are enumerated words, optionally
    // extended by `_`/`-` segments (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
    // `password_confirmation`), while a bare lowercase continuation is left
    // alone as an ordinary English word (`tokenization`, `passwordless`,
    // `secretary`). Because there is no leading boundary, an enumerated word
    // is also matched at the end of a longer key - that is what covers
    // `clientSecret` and `signing_key`, and it is why `cancellationToken:
    // active` and `token_count: 5` are redacted too. That over-redaction is
    // deliberate: no key-only rule separates `token_value` from `token_count`,
    // and losing a counter costs less than leaking a credential.
    //
    // `key` is the exception to that: it is a common English word, so it only
    // counts as a credential key in compound form (`api_key`, `sessionKey`).
    // Bare `key` is left alone, which keeps `Failed to import key: <error>`,
    // `Cache key: video_123` and `KeyEvent: KeyDownEvent` readable. The
    // compound forms are further guarded against every spelling of the public
    // key (`pub_key`, `public_key`, `publicKey`), which support needs for
    // triage and which is public by construction. Plurals count the same as
    // singulars everywhere: `privateKeys` hides a hex-form private key exactly
    // as well as `privateKey` does.
