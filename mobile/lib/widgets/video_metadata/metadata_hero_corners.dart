/// Carries a rounded shape through a [VideoEditorConstants.heroMetaPreviewId]
/// flight.
///
/// The flying widget is lifted into the navigator overlay, above the
/// destination screen's own clip, so that clip cannot reach it — the corners
/// only appear once the flight lands. Clip the shuttle here instead, morphing
/// out of the thumbnail's all-round
/// [VideoEditorConstants.clipPreviewCornerRadius] into
/// [destinationBorderRadius].
///
/// The animation's endpoints mean the same thing in both directions — 0 is the
/// metadata screen, 1 is the destination — because a push drives it from the
/// pushed route's animation and a pop from the popped one. A pop runs 1 to 0,
/// so a single lerp covers the way back.
///
/// Set this from the *destination's* [Hero], not the thumbnail's: on a pop the
/// destination is the thumbnail, which has no builder, so Flutter falls back to
/// the route being left. A builder on the thumbnail would instead win over
/// every destination's.
