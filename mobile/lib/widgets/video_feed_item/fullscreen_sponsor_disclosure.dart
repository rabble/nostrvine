/// A scrim-backed sponsorship label rendered over fullscreen video.

/// [sponsorName] must already be sanitized and clamped by the launching
/// surface. The text deliberately has no line ceiling so the disclosure stays
/// complete at large system text sizes.
///
/// The scrim is sized for the brightest frame rather than the average one.
/// At [VineTheme.scrim65], white text clears 7:1 against a pure-white shot,
/// while remaining quieter than the 80% media-chrome treatment.
///
/// It is deliberately small and quiet rather than sized like a control. This
/// is the one chrome layer that survives immersive viewing, so it is the only
/// thing on screen while the viewer holds the video — heavy enough to read on
/// any frame, light enough not to become the subject.
