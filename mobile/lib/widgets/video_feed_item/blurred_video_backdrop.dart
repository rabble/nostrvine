/// video in `_PooledFullscreenItemContent` so contain-fit videos
/// (1 × 1 / landscape) sit on it instead of a flat dark surface —
/// matches the Instagram / TikTok "blurred poster" look.
///
/// When the video carries a [blurhash], the backdrop renders the decoded
/// 32 × 32 blurhash bilinearly stretched — visually equivalent to a heavy
/// gaussian blur of the poster at zero per-frame raster cost. The
/// runtime-blur fallback ([ImageFiltered], sigma 30) only runs for videos
/// without a blurhash; that fullscreen blur pass over the live video
/// texture was a major raster-thread cost (on-device: Impeller janked
/// every frame), so the blurhash path is strongly preferred.
///
/// When [videoAspectRatio] is known, the backdrop paints only in the letterbox
/// bars — one `RepaintBoundary`-isolated fill per bar, from the screen edge up
/// to the video — instead of a single fullscreen layer behind the (opaque)
/// video. That occluded fullscreen fill, composited whole every frame, was the
/// backdrop's per-frame overdraw cost on Skia; the per-bar layers are cached
/// and never re-rastered by the video texture (PR #5957). When the aspect
/// ratio is unknown the backdrop falls back to a fullscreen fill.
