/// Stop-motion never enters the recording state, so capture mode's
/// duration-based progress bar never appears and the user shoots with no idea
/// how much room is left. This renders the same bar against the session's
/// frame budget instead: each still is held for one output frame, so the
/// ceiling is however many frames fit in the maximum clip length.
///
/// Measured against the same clip-manager total capture mode's bar counts, and
/// at the hold the new stills will actually inherit, so a recorder opened from
/// the editor to top up a clip starts from what that composition has left
/// rather than from a full budget.
///
/// Returns a [Flexible], so it belongs in the top bar's center slot between
/// the close and next buttons — the same slot (and the same shape) lip-sync's
/// audio chip uses.
