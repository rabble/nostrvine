/// A [DivineTextField] with a hard character cap that tells the user when the
/// cap dropped what they pasted.
///
/// The cap exists because sanitization runs on the main isolate and its cost
/// scales with field size; without it a large paste freezes submission. It is
/// applied as an input formatter rather than `maxLength` so the form does not
/// grow a Material character counter under every field, in styling the design
/// system does not own.
///
/// The formatter alone would drop the tail of a pasted crash log without
/// saying so, and that tail can be the exception the user meant to report -
/// nothing else in the payload carries it, since attachments are images only
/// and the log summary comes from in-app logs. So the field reports when the
/// formatter actually rejected characters.
///
/// The notice is driven by a rejection the formatter reports, not by comparing
/// the text length to the cap. Those are different questions and, before they
/// were separated, different units: [LengthLimitingTextInputFormatter] counts
/// grapheme clusters while `String.length` counts UTF-16 code units, so a
/// field of emoji claimed to be full at half its real capacity.
