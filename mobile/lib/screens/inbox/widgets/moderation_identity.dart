/// the profile is `null` and the fallback is a generated "Adjective Animal N".

/// on the other end of a pre-rotation thread. Callers that need a *send target*

/// The account's kind-0 `picture` is the hosted `divine-logo.svg`, which
/// colours its paths through a `<style>` block. `vector_graphics_compiler` has
/// no `<style>` parser, so it discards the stylesheet and every path falls
/// back to opaque black — 1.1:1 against the inbox surface. The bundled
/// `logo.svg` is the same wordmark carrying presentational `fill` attributes
/// instead, so it survives the parser and renders in brand green.
///
/// `BoxFit.cover` matches how divine-web frames the same artwork: the wordmark
/// is 3.8:1, so filling a square avatar crops it to the middle "Vi". Contain
/// would letterbox the whole lockup into an illegible sliver.

/// carry the name "Divine Moderation" and the same [ModerationAvatar]
/// wordmark, and both stamp the same relative timestamp. #6416 already put
/// `dmRetiredThreadClosedTitle` in the preview slot, but in the preview's own
/// font and colour — a sentence sitting where the eye reads "the last thing
/// they said", which is why a closed thread still had to be opened to be
/// recognised (#7847). The lock is what makes it scan as a status instead.

/// The ink stays `onSurfaceVariant`, the colour the preview it replaces
/// already used. Dimming it to `onSurfaceMuted` would have marked the row
/// twice over, but that token is 3.3:1 on the light surface — under the 4.5:1
/// this text needs — so the glyph carries the distinction alone.
///
/// Deliberately reuses the string the opened thread's closed-composer notice
/// puts at its top, rather than a shorter list-only variant, so the row and the
/// screen it opens make the same claim in the same words.
///
/// The glyph carries no semantics of its own — `DivineIcon` renders through
/// `SvgPicture.asset` with no `semanticsLabel` — which is correct here: the
/// sentence beside it already says "closed", and labelling the lock would make
/// assistive tech announce the status twice.
