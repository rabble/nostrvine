///
/// The key is not on this device and NIP-46 defines no method that returns key
/// material, so it comes from Keycast's own export endpoint, authorized by the
/// session's bearer token plus the account password. Keycast keeps both
/// preconditions server-side — a verified email, and the `verified_minor`
/// custody refusal — so nothing here is a way around them.
///
/// Nothing is stored and nothing is shown: the key goes from the response
/// straight to the clipboard the user asked for, and is never rendered,
/// written to disk, or logged. The clipboard is therefore the only route to
/// it — a deliberate trade for keeping key material out of every frame.
