/// Unfocuses the active text field and hides the software keyboard the moment
/// the enclosing [ModalRoute] begins its dismiss transition.
///
/// The comments bottom sheet has no close button — it is dismissed by dragging
/// it down, tapping the scrim, or the system back gesture. Most of those
/// vectors reverse the modal route's transition animation, so
/// [AnimationStatus.reverse] is the primary dismiss signal (#5604). Two
/// teardown paths never emit it (#5959):
///
/// * a chrome drag that rides the route controller to its 0.0 clamp goes
///   completed→forward→dismissed (both fling branches in
///   `material/bottom_sheet.dart` are guarded by `value > 0.0`, and the
///   follow-up pop's `reverse()` takes the zero-duration branch), covered by
///   also reacting to [AnimationStatus.dismissed];
/// * route removal without a pop emits no status change at all, covered by
///   the [dispose] fallback.
///
/// `unfocus()` alone is not enough: when iOS tears down the text-input
/// session during a background/resume cycle, the framework nulls its side of
/// the connection without any outbound `TextInput.hide`, while iOS
/// re-presents the keyboard for the stale first responder on resume. In that
/// split-brain state `unfocus()` produces zero text-input channel traffic, so
/// an explicit `TextInput.hide` — which resigns the first responder
/// engine-side regardless of framework connection state — is sent as well.
///
/// `TextInput.hide` alone is still not enough (#6007): the engine's
/// `hideTextInput` resigns the first responder but never zeroes
/// `_textInputClient`, and in the split-brain state the framework never sends
/// its own `TextInput.clearClient` either. The dismissal then leaves an
/// in-hierarchy `FlutterTextInputView` whose `canBecomeFirstResponder` is
/// still `YES` — a session iOS 26 re-presents on its own (observed in #5959
/// on resume, and stranded over the feed in #6007 with no resume at all). An
/// explicit `TextInput.clearClient` is therefore sent before the hide — the
/// engine's own reset order — so every dismissal ends with client 0, first
/// responder resigned, and the input view removed: nothing left for UIKit to
/// re-present. In the healthy case both raw messages are no-ops racing the
/// framework's identical `clearClient` + scheduled hide, and the resign
/// delegate reports client 0, which the framework's client-id guard drops.
///
/// The [dispose] fallback runs only when no route-status change already
/// dismissed the keyboard and only when there was an enclosing modal route, so
/// it is scoped to a sheet actually tearing down rather than firing on every
/// disposal of a generic subtree.
///
/// Renders [child] unchanged; it only observes the route animation. No-op when
/// there is no enclosing modal route (e.g. a non-modal host).
