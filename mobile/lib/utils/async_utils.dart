/// `Timer(delay, completer.complete)` awaited by a caller keeps running after
/// its owner is gone, and the awaiting code then resumes into a disposed
/// object. `close()`/`dispose()` do not cancel in-flight work, so the wait has
/// to be cancellable from the outside (#8457, epic #4339).
///
/// This is also why the scope is an object rather than a set of static
/// helpers: an "explicit owner" is a field somebody disposes, not a call
/// convention somebody has to remember.
///
/// The owner **must** call [dispose] when its lifecycle ends. The scope cannot
/// infer that its owner went away, and an undisposed scope deliberately keeps
/// its active waits alive until they settle.
///
/// Give the owner a scope and dispose it alongside everything else it owns:
///
/// ```dart
/// class PendingActionService {
///   final _async = AsyncScope(debugName: 'PendingActionService');
///
///   Future<void> _sync(PendingAction action) => _async.retryWithBackoff(
///         operation: () => _executor(action),

///     super.dispose();
