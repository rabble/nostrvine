/// Releasing a heavy resource (camera, video decoder) while the pushed route is
/// still animating in would reveal the placeholder behind it; this defers until
/// the route's [ModalRoute.secondaryAnimation] reaches
/// [AnimationStatus.completed]. Returns immediately only when a screen already
/// fully covers the current route (its secondary animation is already
/// `completed`).
///
/// Intended to be called right after a `push`, where the secondary animation is
/// mid-transition. A route that never becomes covered — no push, or the push is
/// dismissed again — leaves the animation `dismissed`, so the wait resolves only
/// via [timeout]. Pass [timeout] to bound the wait; on timeout the listener is
/// detached and the future resolves. With no [timeout] the wait resolves only
/// once the transition genuinely completes.
