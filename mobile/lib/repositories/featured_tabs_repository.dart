/// * **Staleness.** A successful response is cached; a later failure serves
///   that cache until [cacheTtl] elapses, then drops the tab. The window is
///   deliberately the five minutes funnelcake's own API contract asks for
///   ("drop a cached config after 5 minutes without a successful refresh"), so
///   an outage cannot strand a killed tab on screen. Note the consequence: at
///   a poll cadence of five minutes or slower the cache is already at or past
///   that age whenever a scheduled poll fails, so the first transient failure
///   does drop the tab rather than riding through it. Closing that needs a
///   cadence below the TTL or a retry policy, both of which are the
///   configuration owner's call, not something to buy by quietly serving
///   staler config than the contract allows.
/// * **Eligibility.** A tab renders only when it is enabled, inside its
///   window, has server-side content, and passes the viewer audience rule.
/// * **Selection.** The payload is a list; v1 renders at most one tab, so the
///   first eligible entry wins.
