/// BLoC that filters a follower/following list by a search query.
///
/// The list itself stays owned by the screen's list BLoC — this one only
/// holds the query plus the display names needed to match against it, and
/// exposes the filter through [FollowListSearchState.visibleFrom]. That keeps
/// the two lists from drifting apart: there is exactly one source of pubkeys.
///
/// Matching runs from two sides, and a row qualifies if either one hits:
///
///  * **Server-side.** [FollowRepository.searchFollowList] asks the API which
///    members of this list match, which is the only path that can find someone
///    on a device with a cold profile cache. It answers only for accounts the
///    API has indexed, and returns nothing at all where the endpoint is not
///    deployed yet.
///  * **On-device.** Names are resolved for the candidate list in chunks,
///    re-emitting after each one so results refine progressively instead of
///    blocking on the whole list. This keeps working offline and covers list
///    members the API does not know. A pubkey whose profile never resolves
///    still matches on its deterministic fallback name — the same name the
///    list tile renders.
