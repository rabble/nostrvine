/// dedup collapses any redundant copy). It must be used instead of
/// re-dispatching [ConversationMessageSent], which would build a fresh rumor
/// with a new id — leaving the old failed row still sweep-retryable and
/// risking a duplicate at the recipient.

/// bubble's id is its rumor id) either at SnackBar-Retry tap time or from a
