/// Safely reads a GoRouter `state.extra` payload as [T].
///
/// Returns `null` when [extra] is not a [T]. This matters after route
/// restoration or a deep link: Flutter serializes `extra` and hands it back
/// as a plain `Map<String, dynamic>` rather than the originally-passed typed
/// object, so a raw `extra as T` cast throws
/// `type '_Map<String, dynamic>' is not a subtype of type 'T'` and crashes the
/// route builder (Crashlytics iOS 5b96bfc6…, efec8882…). Each affected route
/// already tolerates a missing payload (optional hints, id-based loaders, or a
/// `??` fallback), so returning `null` degrades gracefully instead of crashing.
///
/// The deeper fix is to stop passing typed objects through `extra` entirely
/// (see `.claude/rules/routing.md` — `extra` breaks deep linking and
/// restoration); that migration is tracked separately.
