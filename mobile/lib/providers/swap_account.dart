/// Switches the live app to [account] in place: builds a new container on the

/// left. Its signer credentials (OAuth session, bunker URL, Amber info) live in
/// shared secure-storage slots that the incoming account's sign-in overwrites,
/// so they are archived per-account first. The sign-out this swap replaced used
/// to do that; without it the leaving account comes back as "session expired"
/// with no refresh token left to recover from.
///
/// That archive is a precondition, not a best-effort side trip: it throws if
/// the write fails, aborting before anything is mutated, because a swap that
/// carries on past it destroys the credentials it was meant to preserve.
///
/// Prove-then-commit: nothing user-visible changes until the new account's
/// sign-in succeeds. On failure the half-built container is disposed and the
/// current account's container is left untouched — the rollback the previous
/// welcome-bounce flow could not guarantee (#4623). Rethrows so the caller can
/// surface a "couldn't switch" affordance. The archive survives that rollback
/// intentionally: it only ever copies the leaving account's own credentials
/// into its own slot.
///
/// Push deregistration follows the same commit boundary. The outgoing
/// coordinator is captured before sign-in can replace shared signer storage,
/// but it runs only after [AccountSwitchController.swapTo] commits the target.
/// The swap host retains the outgoing container until cleanup settles so its
/// account-scoped signer remains usable throughout deregistration.
///
/// Rolling the container back is not enough on its own: a sign-in that got far
/// enough to fail has already restored the *target* account's signer keys over
/// the shared slots and persisted its auth source, which the live container
/// never re-reads but the next cold launch does. The rollback restores the
/// leaving account's keys from the archive written above. It cannot throw:
/// callers dispatch on the sign-in failure's type, so a rollback that escaped
/// would swap out the type they match on and cost the user the recovery route.
///
/// [signIn] is injectable for testing; production uses [signInForAccount].
