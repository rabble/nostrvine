/// Wraps [source] in a provider whose value is a stream of [source]'s
/// successive values, seeded with the value current at subscribe time.
///
/// This exists for a narrow case: a bloc created once in an app-shell
/// `BlocProvider` whose `create:` captures a Riverpod dependency that later
/// changes identity (auth flip, account switch, sign-out, `ref.invalidate`).
/// The two cheaper cures are both closed off in that position:
///
/// * A record-typed `ValueKey` on the `BlocProvider` — shipped and **reverted**
///   in #4918. Keying a provider that sits above `MaterialApp.router` remounts
///   the router and shell on every startup and every account switch.
/// * A sync `ConsumerWidget` calling `context.read<Bloc>()` from a Riverpod
///   listener (`AppShellBadgeScope`) — needs `lazy: false` to avoid the #6115
///   re-entrant lazy create, which defeats feature-flag gating that relies on
///   the bloc staying lazy.
///
/// So the bloc subscribes to the change instead — `state_management.md` rule
/// exception #2. Inject the stream at `create:` and re-point the field on each
/// emission.
///
/// Subscribers receive the **current** value first, then every later change.
/// That matters because blocs typically subscribe from an event handler rather
/// than their constructor, and a plain broadcast stream would drop the seed.
/// A subscriber that already holds the current instance should guard with
/// `identical` — the seed is delivered unconditionally.
///
/// Change detection is Riverpod's, i.e. `==`. The dependencies this is used
/// with do not override `==`, so equality falls through to identity, which is
/// exactly the signal we want. **If one ever gains value equality this goes
/// silent** — the same failure mode `state_management.md` documents for
/// record-typed `ValueKey`s.
///
/// Returns a plain (non-codegen) `Provider`, which is not auto-disposed — the
/// container-level listener below has to stay armed for the container's whole
/// life, not just while someone holds a subscription. Do not convert this to a
/// `@riverpod`-generated provider without re-checking that.

    // then leaves [source] dirty-but-not-recomputed and the callback never
