/// Deliberately carries no reason or moderation metadata, for two reasons that
/// are worth keeping apart because only the first survives a change of backend:
///
/// 1. Stored moderation reasons are internal operational metadata, not
///    reviewed or localised user copy. Account-level notices describe the
///    state and its effects without rendering that metadata
///    (support-trust-safety#200 R-7).
/// 2. Funnelcake's self-status API happens not to return one today, and asserts
///    that in its own suite. This is why the omission is currently free.
///
/// Reason (2) arrived with the move from Keycast to Funnelcake and reads like
/// the whole story; it is not. Copy is chosen from [kind] alone. See #8304 for
/// the account-level policy decision and `account_status_api_client_test.dart`
/// for the client-side guard.
