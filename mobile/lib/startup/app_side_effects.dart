/// a provider belongs here when activating it costs no more than the
/// already-constructed `authServiceProvider`, **or** when its whole point is to
/// keep working while the bottom-nav shell is not mounted.

/// activated from `AppShell.build()`, which does not run until the user lands
/// on a bottom-nav tab — so for the whole pre-shell window (splash, auth
/// restore, sign-up, e-mail verification, onboarding) Crashlytics reports and
/// Firebase Analytics events carried no `user_id`, even for an already
/// authenticated user restored from the keychain. Both providers' own dartdoc
/// said "watch this provider at app startup"; this host is what makes that
