/// Listens for background upload completions and shows the appropriate UI.
///
/// Uses [NavigatorKeys.root] to obtain a [BuildContext] inside the
/// [Navigator] tree, which [showModalBottomSheet] and [ScaffoldMessenger]
/// require.
///
/// **Failure tracking:** Tracks the set of currently-failed draft IDs so that
/// only *new* failures trigger a sheet. When a draft is retried or dismissed
/// its ID leaves the failed set, so a subsequent failure is detected as new.
///
/// **Success tracking (publish-flow continuity, #4626):** Reads
/// [BackgroundPublishState.recentlySucceededIds] — populated by the bloc only
/// on a true [PublishSuccess], never on [BackgroundPublishVanished] — so a
/// vanished upload cannot produce a false "published" snackbar. If the user is
/// not yet authenticated at the moment of success (mid re-auth redirect), the
/// count is buffered and shown once authentication is restored.
