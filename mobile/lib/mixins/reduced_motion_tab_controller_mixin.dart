/// Owns a [TabController] that honours the platform's reduced-motion setting.
///
/// [TabController.animationDuration] drives both the [TabBar] indicator slide
/// and the [TabBarView] page transition, and Flutter short-circuits both when
/// it is [Duration.zero] — but it is fixed at construction. Reacting to a
/// mid-session toggle therefore means building a replacement controller, which
/// is what [syncTabController] does. It handles the same swap for a changed
/// [tabCount], so screens with conditional tabs need only the one call.
///
/// Requires [TickerProviderStateMixin] rather than
/// `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`, which permits only one ticker per State
/// and throws on the second controller.
///
/// ```dart
/// class _MyViewState extends State<MyView>
///     with TickerProviderStateMixin, ReducedMotionTabControllerMixin {
///   @override
///   int get tabCount => 3;

///   void onTabChanged() => setState(() {});
///
///   @override
///   void didChangeDependencies() {
///     super.didChangeDependencies();
///     syncTabController();
