## Summary
Issue #116 (Implement Comment System with Threaded Replies) has been **COMPLETED**. The full comment system is already implemented and functional.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

- `lib/models/comment.dart` - Complete Comment model with Hive serialization
- Support for threaded comments with parent/child relationships
- Proper Nostr event ID tracking and author information

### 2. **SocialService Integration**
- `lib/services/social_service.dart` - Comment methods implemented:
  - `postComment()` - Creates Kind 1 events with proper e/p tags
  - `fetchCommentsForEvent()` - Streams comments for a video
  - `getCommentCount()` - Returns comment count for UI display

### 3. **State Management**
- `lib/providers/comments_provider.dart` - Complete provider implementation:
  - Hierarchical comment tree building
  - Optimistic UI updates for posting
  - Real-time comment loading and caching
  - Reply threading and expansion state management

### 4. **User Interface**
- `lib/screens/comments_screen.dart` - Full-featured comments UI:
  - Threaded comment display with visual indentation
  - Reply input with context-sensitive placement
  - Real-time comment posting and error handling
  - Collapsible comment threads

### 5. **Video Feed Integration**
- `lib/widgets/video_feed_item_v2.dart` - Complete integration:
  - Comment button with live count display
  - Navigation to CommentsScreen
  - Proper import and dependency setup

## 📋 Nostr Implementation Details

### Kind 1 Comment Events
Comments use standard Nostr Kind 1 (text note) events with proper tagging:

```
{
  "kind": 1,
  "content": "This is a comment",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<video_event_id>", "", "root"],  // References video
    ["p", "<video_author_pubkey>"],         // Tags video author
    ["e", "<parent_comment_id>", "", "reply"], // For replies (optional)
    ["p", "<parent_comment_author>"]        // Tags parent author (optional)
  ]
}
```

### Threading Structure
- **Root comments**: Reference video event ID with "root" marker
- **Replies**: Reference both root video and parent comment with "reply" marker
- **Author tagging**: All relevant authors are tagged for notifications

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Post top-level comments on videos
- ✅ Reply to existing comments (threaded)
- ✅ Real-time comment loading
- ✅ Comment count display in video feed
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates

### User Experience
- ✅ Visual thread indentation
- ✅ Relative timestamp display (2h ago, 1d ago)
- ✅ Author identification with pubkey truncation
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Reply context switching

### Technical Features
- ✅ Nostr protocol compliance (NIP-01)
- ✅ Proper event tagging for discoverability
- ✅ Memory-efficient comment caching
- ✅ Hierarchical data structure optimization

## 🔄 Current Status
The comment system is **production-ready** and fully functional. All requirements from Issue #116 have been implemented:

1. ✅ Nostr Kind 1 events for comments
2. ✅ Proper e/p tag threading
3. ✅ SocialService methods for posting/fetching
4. ✅ CommentsProvider for state management
5. ✅ CommentsScreen UI implementation
6. ✅ VideoFeedItem integration with comment counts
7. ✅ Threaded reply support

## 🚀 Ready for Use
The comment system can be used immediately. Users can:
- Tap the comment button on any video to open the comments screen
- View existing comments in a threaded format
- Post new comments and replies
- See real-time comment counts

## 📝 Notes
- Comments are posted as Kind 1 Nostr events, allowing replies to Kind 22 videos
- The system follows Nostr best practices for event tagging and threading
- All UI components are responsive and handle loading/error states properly
- The implementation supports the full comment lifecycle from creation to display

**Recommendation**: Issue #116 can be closed as the comment system with threaded replies is fully implemented and functional.
