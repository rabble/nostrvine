                        In an era where AI can generate anything, filter everything, and perfect every frame, 
                        I found myself longing for something real. Something raw. Something that captured 
                        the pure, unfiltered joy of human creativity in six-second bursts.

                    <p>
                        Between 2013 and 2017, Vine wasn't just an app‚Äîit was a cultural phenomenon. 
                        Six seconds to make someone laugh, cry, or say "wait, play that again." 
                        No algorithms deciding what you should see. No AI-enhanced filters. 
                        Just pure, authentic human creativity looping endlessly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>üíö Why Bring It Back?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As social media became increasingly algorithmic, filtered, and AI-driven, 
                        we lost something precious: the raw authenticity of capturing a moment and 
                        sharing it instantly. No post-production. No AI enhancement. Just you, 
                        your camera, and six seconds to create magic.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That's why I built OpenVine‚Äîa retro tribute to the original Vine, but with 
                        a twist. It's completely open source and built on the Nostr protocol, meaning 
                        no single company can shut it down. Your vines live forever on a decentralized 
                        network, owned by you and the community.

                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm <a href="https://rabblelabs.com" target="_blank">Rabble</a>, and I built OpenVine 
                        because I missed the simplicity and authenticity of the original Vine. In a world 
                        of increasingly complex social media, sometimes you just want to capture a moment 
                        and share it‚Äîno filters, no AI, no algorithm deciding who sees it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OpenVine is my love letter to the golden age of social video, when creativity 
                        thrived within constraints and authenticity was the only currency that mattered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was inspired by <a href="https://kyledrake.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Drake</a>'s 
                        <a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, which beautifully revived 
                        the spirit of GeoCities. Just as Neocities brought back the joy of personal websites, 
                        OpenVine aims to resurrect the magic of spontaneous, creative video sharing.

                    <p>
                        Due to Vine.co's archive going offline, we were able to recover many classic Vine videos, 
                        but unfortunately couldn't reliably link them back to their original creators. These videos 
                        are preserved here as a piece of internet history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Our commitment:</strong> If we find a way to restore entire accounts or identify 
                        original creators, we will immediately give them back control of their content. If you're 
                        an original Vine creator and recognize your work, please reach out and we'll transfer 
                        ownership to you.
