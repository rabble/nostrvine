                        In an era where AI can generate anything, filter everything, and perfect every frame, 
                        I found myself longing for something real. Something raw. Something that captured 
                        the pure, unfiltered joy of human creativity in six-second bursts.

                    <p>
                        Between 2013 and 2017, <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> wasn't just an app‚Äîit was a cultural phenomenon. 
                        Six seconds to make someone laugh, cry, or say "wait, play that again." 
                        No algorithms deciding what you should see. No AI-enhanced filters. 
                        Just pure, authentic human creativity looping endlessly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Want to dive deep into <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span>'s incredible story? Check out 
                        <a href="https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/42L2tD/" target="_blank">the <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> history podcast</a> 
                        for a fascinating look at how <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> changed social media forever.

                <div class="philosophy-section">
                    <h3>üíö Why Bring It Back?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I did this because I was recording interviews for my <a href="https://revolution.social" target="_blank">revolution.social</a> 
                        podcast and <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> kept coming up. It was an era that was lost. Everyone had stories about 
                        their favorite <span class="vine-brand">Vines</span>, creators they loved, moments that defined internet culture‚Äîall gone.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I wondered, how hard could it be today to build <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span>? Turns out, not so hard. 
                        It's taken me about as much time to create <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span> as it took us at Odeo to 
                        build the first launched version of Twitter.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But more importantly, we lost our digital rights. When Twitter shut down <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> in 2017, 
                        millions of creators lost years of work overnight. Their videos, their communities, 
                        their creative legacy‚Äîgone because one company made a business decision.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Never again should we build an ecosystem that can be shutdown like happened with <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span>.</strong> 
                        That's why I built <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span>‚Äîa retro tribute to the original <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span>, but with 
                        a twist. It's completely open source and built on the Nostr protocol, meaning 
                        no single company can shut it down. Your vines live forever on a decentralized 
                        network, owned by you and the community.

                    <h3>Fighting for Digital Rights</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span> upholds the fundamental rights laid out in <a href="https://rights.social" target="_blank">rights.social</a>. 
                        We want every social media platform and protocol to uphold these basic rights:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="rights-list">
                        <li><strong>Right to Ownership:</strong> Your content belongs to you, not the platform</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Take your data and followers anywhere</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Privacy:</strong> Control who sees your content and how it's used</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Transparency:</strong> Know how algorithms affect your content</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Permanence:</strong> Your digital legacy shouldn't disappear overnight</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> shutdown was a wake-up call. We can't let corporate decisions destroy our digital culture again. 
                        <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span> is built to last‚Äîdecentralized, open source, and community-owned.

                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm <a href="https://rabblelabs.com" target="_blank">Rabble</a>, and I built <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span> 
                        because I missed the simplicity and authenticity of the original <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span>. In a world 
                        of increasingly complex social media, sometimes you just want to capture a moment 
                        and share it‚Äîno filters, no AI, no algorithm deciding who sees it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span> is my love letter to the golden age of social video, when creativity 
                        thrived within constraints and authenticity was the only currency that mattered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was inspired by <a href="https://kyledrake.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Drake</a>'s 
                        <a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, which beautifully revived 
                        the spirit of GeoCities. Just as Neocities brought back the joy of personal websites, 
                        <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span> aims to resurrect the magic of spontaneous, creative video sharing.

                    <h3>üìº About the <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> Archive</h3>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to the heroic efforts of <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Vine" target="_blank">ArchiveTeam</a> 
                        who worked tirelessly in 2017 to save most of <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> before it shut down, we've been able to 
                        recover many classic <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> videos. It's their hard work that made <span class="vine-brand">OpenVine</span>'s content restoration possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, we couldn't reliably link all videos back to their original creators. These videos 
                        are preserved here as a piece of internet history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Our commitment:</strong> If we find a way to restore entire accounts or identify 
                        original creators, we will immediately give them back control of their content. If you're 
                        an original <span class="vine-brand">Vine</span> creator and recognize your work, please reach out and we'll transfer 
                        ownership to you.
