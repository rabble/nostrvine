# Profile Pinning Evidence Audit

**Date:** 2026-08-23

**Status:** Complete; evidence appendix for the pinned-video report

## Why this audit exists

This audit separates four different kinds of statement that had been mixed
together in earlier report drafts:

1. behavior already shipped by a Divine client;
2. behavior required or recommended by a Nostr NIP;
3. behavior verified in the current mobile and relay code;
4. new product or implementation recommendations made by the report.

The consolidated report uses this appendix to distinguish established behavior,
protocol facts, engineering risks, and report recommendations.

## Established Divine behavior

Divine Web already implements profile video pins. Commit
[`0058e2f5`](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-web/commit/0058e2f51091501e0cf04fe3018f05fff0460eb9)
(`feat: pinned videos on user profiles (#140)`, authored by Rabble on
2026-03-01) is the cross-client precedent:

- `divine-web/src/hooks/usePinnedVideos.ts` reads and writes kind `10001`.
- Video identities are kind-`34236` `a` coordinates.
- New pins are appended to the stored tag list.
- The web limit is three pins.
- The parser accepts values beginning with `34236:` regardless of whether the
  video author is the pin-list owner. It does not strictly validate the pubkey
  or `d` value.
- Other tags are retained during pin and unpin, but both mutations replace
  `content` with an empty string. That can erase private list items stored there.

Current Divine Web behavior includes one later improvement and two remaining
risks:

- Commit
  [`e74b6b04`](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-web/commit/e74b6b042eb976600683ee830360cfa27592cfbb)
  added deterministic newest-event selection for each video coordinate.
- Kind-10001 reads still query with `limit: 1` and compare only timestamps, so
  they have the same equal-timestamp winner defect identified for Mobile.
- The owned-profile unpin lookup keys by `d` value alone. Two authors using the
  same `d` value can select the wrong foreign-authored coordinate.

This makes kind `10001` plus kind-`34236` `a` tags an existing Divine
convention. It does not make that combination standard NIP-51 behavior.

The current Funnelcake code policy auto-allows the NIP-01 replaceable range
`10000..19999` and addressable range `30000..39999` unless a NIP-86
`disallowkind` record explicitly blocks the kind. That policy landed in commit
[`7dcb41c6`](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-funnelcake/commit/7dcb41c6e5e3f112ff699901743fbe5291c7e647)
on 2026-07-29. An older Divine Web issue reporting that kind `10001` was
rejected by `relay.divine.video` predates this policy and is not a description
of the current relay code. Code policy alone does not prove the current
production `disallowed_kinds` state.

## Primary Nostr findings

### Kind 10001 is standardized for pinned notes, not addressable videos

NIP-51 names kind `10001` **Pinned notes** and expects `e` tags that reference
kind-1 notes. NIP-51's general list mechanism permits list items in tags, but it
does not standardize kind-`34236` `a` tags inside kind `10001`.

The Divine representation must therefore be described as an existing Divine
extension to the kind-10001 list, with the interoperability consequence that a
generic NIP-51 client may ignore the video `a` tags.

### Addressable video coordinates are the correct stable reference

NIP-01 defines an `a` reference as `kind:pubkey:d-tag`. NIP-71 defines kind
`34236` as addressable short-form video. The coordinate remains stable across a
replacement only while the author pubkey and `d` value remain unchanged.

The codec must require an exact 64-character lowercase hexadecimal pubkey.
Mobile must also require a nonempty `d` value because the current
`VideoEvent.addressableId` and `getVideosByAddressableIds` paths reject an empty
value; that is a current-mobile compatibility rule rather than explicit NIP-71
normative language. `AId.fromString` rejoins colons in a `d` value but does not
enforce these validity rules.

### NIP-51 recommends chronological storage order

NIP-51 says clients SHOULD append new list items so the stored order remains
chronological. The approved mobile design instead prepends and displays newest
pin first. That is a deliberate SHOULD-level interoperability deviation, not a
claim about standard NIP-51 behavior. Divine Web currently appends. Both clients
preserve stored tag order, but render different subsets; among coordinates both
display, order follows the stored sequence. A pin action inserts at opposite
ends. A Web-written or mixed-client list has no per-item timestamps, so mobile
cannot reconstruct a globally newest-first chronology.

### Replaceable winners need a complete comparator

For equal `created_at` values, NIP-01 says the event with the lexicographically
lowest event ID should be retained. The current mobile Nostr client reapplies
`limit: 1` after sorting only by timestamp. A kind-10001 query with `limit: 1`
can therefore discard the expected winner before a repository applies the ID
tie-break.

With the current client, the pin repository must query without `limit: 1` and
select by:

```text
created_at descending, then event ID ascending
```

Alternatively, `_mergeEvents` must first be corrected to apply the same
tie-break before limiting. The comparator must also guard live subscription
updates.

## Current mobile findings

### Verified foundations

- `ProfileFeedCubit` owns the canonical newest-first base sequence in
  `_unfilteredVideos` (`mobile/lib/blocs/profile_feed/profile_feed_cubit.dart:125-132`).
- `VideoEvent.addressableId` produces the full kind-`34236` coordinate.
- `VideoEvent.stableId` is not a global pin identity because it omits the
  author when a `vineId` exists
  (`mobile/packages/models/lib/src/video_event.dart:1085-1088,1359-1375`).
- `VideosRepository.getVideosByAddressableIds` batches 20 coordinates, so 12
  unique pins fit in one relay batch. Funnelcake fallback and hydration can
  still cause additional requests
  (`mobile/packages/videos_repository/lib/src/videos_repository.dart:1469-1582`).
- The current grid prefixes owner-only upload placeholders ahead of published
  videos (`mobile/lib/widgets/profile/profile_videos_grid.dart:277-349`).
- The current fullscreen catch-up merge sorts newest-first and therefore
  destroys a pinned launch order
  (`mobile/lib/widgets/profile/profile_video_feed_view.dart:113-153`).

### Engineering findings relevant to future implementation

1. **Pin overlays and pagination need separate centralized sequences.** Current
   cold-load, cache, REST, Nostr load-more, enrichment, relay, and filter paths
   directly emit the filtered base feed. `_onRelaySnapshot` also compares the
   pin-augmented state against the unpinned base and can remove pins during a
   routine callback. Every video emit and comparison needs one centralized
   base-to-displayed derivation
   (`profile_feed_cubit.dart:204-207,255-258,299-302,536-538,576-579,631-633,648-659,678`).
   Keep raw base, normally filtered base, and displayed sequences separate.
   Backfill counts use the normally filtered base. The Nostr `until` cursor uses
   `min(_unfilteredVideos.map((video) => video.nostrCreatedAt))`, not
   `createdAt` and not pin-augmented `state.videos`; `createdAt` can represent
   the video's original `published_at` and move the boundary too far backward
   (`profile_feed_cubit.dart:404-460,510-516,727-744`,
   `video_event.dart:1090-1097`).
2. **A naive orderer can drop valid base-feed entries.** Pin-specific owner and
   visibility validation must apply to resolved pins, not re-filter the existing
   authoritative base sequence. Append that base sequence unchanged, minus
   exact duplicates.
3. **Overlapping copies are not reconciled.** When both inputs contain one
   coordinate, neither the feed nor separately resolved copy should win by input
   position. Different event IDs require NIP-01 winner selection by
   `nostrCreatedAt` descending then event ID ascending. Same-event enrichment
   precedence and merging are implementation policy that future engineering
   work must state and test explicitly. Preserve the authoritative base
   sequence position.
4. **Video replacement resolution is nondeterministic.** Mobile's
   `getVideosByAddressableIds` currently lets arrival order choose between
   multiple versions of one coordinate. It must select the raw NIP-01 winner by
   timestamp/ID before parsing and visibility filtering; otherwise an older
   playable version can incorrectly replace a newer filtered version
   (`videos_repository.dart:1529-1558`). Raw-resolved coordinates must be
   tracked independently from visible results: the current fallback path treats
   absence from the visible map as missing and can reintroduce an older visible
   Funnelcake representation of a canonical-but-filtered event
   (`videos_repository.dart:1561-1570,1613-1629`). Canonicalize across sources
   before visibility filtering, or otherwise prevent fallback for a coordinate
   already resolved canonically.
5. **`restartable()` is not enough.** Cancelling a Bloc handler does not cancel
   its underlying resolver future. A generation guard or `emit.isDone` check
   is required before a stale result mutates pin state.
6. **Grid-to-fullscreen identity is already lossy.** The grid constructs a
   de-duplicated displayed list but its tap handler substitutes `state.videos`
   whenever Cubit state is nonempty. Index, prefetch, and fullscreen seed can
   therefore differ from what the user tapped
   (`profile_videos_grid.dart:249-252,315-339,425-430`). The rendered published
   sequence must be authoritative, and the exact addressable coordinate must be
   threaded into fullscreen. Seeing that coordinate in a later live page does
   not by itself prove the live sequence has reconciled the displayed launch
   sequence; switching early can still drop or reorder seed videos.
7. **Exact identity must be threaded end to end.** Future work must include
   `FullscreenFeedBloc` and its tests in the addressable-coordinate path.
8. **Publish language overclaims certainty.** A fully settled query covers the
   configured relay fan-out, not every relay. `OK true` means accepted for
   writing, not durable. A lost `OK` can leave the remote outcome unknown.
   Failed mutations may keep local visible order unchanged; they cannot
   guarantee the previous order is still live everywhere.
9. **A snackbar alone is insufficient.** `.claude/rules/accessibility.md` requires
   `SemanticsService.sendAnnouncement` for snackbars and asynchronous visible
   changes.
10. **A new package requires complete CI ownership.** If engineering creates a
    repository package, it also
    requires `analysis_options.yaml`, a package CI workflow, a measured package
    coverage-floor entry, and the package CI/coverage floor checks.
11. **Use the supported analyzer command.** The supported command is
    `cd mobile && flutter analyze`, without positional directories.
12. **Mutation serialization is only process-local.** A future chain can order
    one app process, but two devices or Web and mobile can read the same base and
    publish competing replacements. New events normally need
    `max(now, selectedBase.createdAt + 1,
    lastLocallyIssuedOrAcceptedCreatedAt + 1)` for same-process ordering, because
    the next configured-relay read may not return the process's last accepted
    write. The repository must fail or defer safely if that timestamp exceeds
    the relay's accepted future-skew boundary. Cross-device writes still follow
    NIP-01 replaceable-winner behavior.
13. **Filter changes cannot restore a pin omitted during resolution.** The
    current addressable resolver filters block, deletion, transport, expiry,
    and content policy before returning. The existing filter-change handler
    re-filters without refetching. The corrected design must either re-resolve
    missing coordinates when filter policy changes or retain canonical raw
    winners below the Cubit visibility layer.
14. **A nonnull `addressableId` does not prove kind 34236.** The model getter
    hardcodes `34236` for any nonempty addressable `d` value. Pin eligibility
    must also require the source `eventKind` to be the addressable short-video
    kind; a nonnull coordinate alone is insufficient.
15. **Mobile has no sanctioned pin glyph yet.** `DivineIcon` accepts only
    `DivineIconName`, whose current enum has no pin entry, and Mobile has no
    Phosphor dependency or pin asset. Reusing Web's Phosphor `PushPin` visual
    requires an approved SVG asset, enum/mapping entry, and mapping test; it
    cannot be requested as though the glyph already exists
    (`mobile/packages/divine_ui/lib/src/icon/divine_icon.dart:9-256`).

## Approved mobile decisions and known divergence

The consolidated report retains these approved mobile product choices:

- mobile prepends new pins and displays newest pin first;
- mobile caps creator-managed pins at 12;
- mobile manages and displays only owner-authored video coordinates;
- foreign and otherwise unrelated tags remain preserved as unrelated data.

The evidence audit does not revoke those choices. It records their consequences:
Divine Web currently appends, limits adding at three, and displays
foreign-authored coordinates. Web will read more than three but refuses another
addition whenever the list already contains at least three video tags. Any Web
convergence is separate cross-repo work, not a hidden prerequisite of this
mobile task.

## Report Recommendations for Edge Cases

### 1. Web-written or mixed-client order

Both clients preserve stored tag order for the coordinate subset they display,
but mobile prepends while Web appends. Without per-item timestamps, mobile
cannot infer a global pin chronology for an existing Web-written or mixed-client
sequence. Treat stored order as authoritative and guarantee only that a Mobile
Pin action moves that video to the front.

### 2. Cap counting and imported lists over 12

Open Nostr data can exceed a local creator cap. Count every unique valid
owner-authored stored reference, including unresolved or hidden references.
Display from the first 12 candidates, preserve the complete event, permit
Unpin, and reject new Pin actions while the managed count is at or above 12.
Only visible videos resolved from those first 12 candidates are active displayed
pins and receive the badge, pin-rank semantics, and pinned-first position. A
stored overflow member can appear later through the base feed without the badge
or pinned semantics, while still offering Unpin to remove that stored entry.

### 3. Pin action while the first snapshot loads

Disable Pin until the first cache/relay snapshot establishes current membership
and count. Do not guess or publish from an unknown base.

### 4. Legacy or non-addressable video action

Omit Pin for a legacy/non-addressable video. Eligibility must use the source
event kind plus a nonempty `d` value, not `addressableId != null` alone.

## Implementation choices, not product facts

The following may be reasonable, but they must be justified as implementation
choices rather than treated as protocol requirements or established product
facts:

- SharedPreferences as the cache backend;
- caching the complete selected raw event;
- inserting rewritten managed tags at the first managed-tag slot;
- preserving extra fields on surviving managed tags;
- serializing mutations per owner;
- the exact cache backend, schema, expiry, and corruption behavior;
- the exact mutation result enums and retry state shape;
- exact semantics wording and whether it includes overall position, pin rank,
  or total pin count.

The Phosphor `PushPin` glyph has a current Divine Web precedent. Reusing it in
mobile is a cross-client design-system proposal, not a Nostr requirement.
