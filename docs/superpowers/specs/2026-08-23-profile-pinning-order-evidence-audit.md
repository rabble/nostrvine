# Profile Pinning Evidence Audit

**Date:** 2026-08-23

**Status:** Complete; evidence appendix for the pinned-video report

## Why this audit exists

This audit separates four different kinds of statement that had been mixed
together in earlier report drafts:

1. behavior already shipped by a Divine client;
2. behavior required or recommended by a Nostr NIP;
3. behavior verified in the current mobile and relay code;
4. new product or implementation recommendations made by the report.

The consolidated report uses this appendix to distinguish established behavior,
protocol facts, engineering risks, and report recommendations.

## Established Divine behavior

Divine Web already implements profile video pins. Commit
[`0058e2f5`](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-web/commit/0058e2f51091501e0cf04fe3018f05fff0460eb9)
(`feat: pinned videos on user profiles (#140)`, authored by Rabble on
2026-03-01) is the cross-client precedent:

- `divine-web/src/hooks/usePinnedVideos.ts` reads and writes kind `10001`.
- Video identities are kind-`34236` `a` coordinates.
- New pins are appended to the stored tag list.
- The web limit is three pins.
- The parser accepts values beginning with `34236:` regardless of whether the
  video author is the pin-list owner. It does not strictly validate the pubkey
  or `d` value.
- Other tags are retained during pin and unpin, but both mutations replace
  `content` with an empty string. That can erase private list items stored there.

Current Divine Web behavior includes one later improvement and two remaining
risks:

- Commit
  [`e74b6b04`](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-web/commit/e74b6b042eb976600683ee830360cfa27592cfbb)
  added deterministic newest-event selection for each video coordinate.
- Kind-10001 reads still query with `limit: 1` and compare only timestamps, so
  they have the same equal-timestamp winner defect identified for Mobile.
- The owned-profile unpin lookup keys by `d` value alone. Two authors using the
  same `d` value can select the wrong foreign-authored coordinate.

This makes kind `10001` plus kind-`34236` `a` tags an existing Divine
convention. It does not make that combination standard NIP-51 behavior.

The current Funnelcake code policy automatically passes the kind-allowlist gate
for the NIP-01 replaceable range `10000..19999` and addressable range
`30000..39999` unless a NIP-86 `disallowkind` record explicitly blocks the kind.
Signature, timestamp, size, moderation, schema, rate-limit, and write-queue
checks can still reject an event. The kind policy landed in commit
[`7dcb41c6`](https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-funnelcake/commit/7dcb41c6e5e3f112ff699901743fbe5291c7e647)
on 2026-07-29. An older Divine Web issue reporting that kind `10001` was
rejected by `relay.divine.video` predates this policy and is not a description
of the current relay code. Code policy alone does not prove the current
production `disallowed_kinds` state.

## Primary Nostr findings

### Kind 10001 is standardized for pinned notes, not addressable videos

NIP-51 names kind `10001` **Pinned notes** and expects `e` tags that reference
kind-1 notes. NIP-51's general list mechanism permits list items in tags, but it
does not standardize kind-`34236` `a` tags inside kind `10001`.

The Divine representation must therefore be described as an existing Divine
extension to the kind-10001 list, with the interoperability consequence that a
generic NIP-51 client may ignore the video `a` tags.

### Addressable video coordinates are the correct stable reference

NIP-01 defines an `a` reference as `kind:pubkey:d-tag`. NIP-71 defines kind
`34236` as addressable short-form video. The coordinate remains stable across a
replacement only while the author pubkey and `d` value remain unchanged.

The codec must require an exact 64-character lowercase hexadecimal pubkey.
Mobile must also require a nonempty `d` value because the current
`VideoEvent.addressableId` and `getVideosByAddressableIds` paths reject an empty
value; that is a current-mobile compatibility rule rather than explicit NIP-71
normative language. `AId.fromString` rejoins colons in a `d` value but does not
enforce these validity rules.

### NIP-51 recommends chronological storage order

NIP-51 says clients SHOULD append new list items so the stored order remains
chronological. The recommended mobile design instead prepends and displays newest
pin first. That is a deliberate SHOULD-level interoperability deviation, not a
claim about standard NIP-51 behavior. Divine Web currently appends and preserves
stored tag order. The recommended Mobile design would preserve order but render
a different subset and insert at the opposite end. A Web-written or
mixed-client list has no per-item timestamps, so Mobile cannot reconstruct a
globally newest-first chronology.

### Replaceable winners need a complete comparator

For equal `created_at` values, NIP-01 says the event with the lexicographically
lowest event ID should be retained. The current mobile Nostr client reapplies
`limit: 1` after sorting only by timestamp. A kind-10001 query with `limit: 1`
can therefore discard the expected winner before a repository applies the ID
tie-break.

With the current client, the pin repository must query without `limit: 1` and
select by:

```text
created_at descending, then event ID ascending
```

Alternatively, `_mergeEvents` must first be corrected to apply the same
tie-break before limiting. The comparator must also guard live subscription
updates.

## Current mobile findings

### Verified foundations

- `ProfileFeedCubit` owns the canonical newest-first base sequence in
  `_unfilteredVideos` (`mobile/lib/blocs/profile_feed/profile_feed_cubit.dart:125-132`).
- `VideoEvent.addressableId` produces the full kind-`34236` coordinate.
- `VideoEvent.stableId` is not a global pin identity because it omits the
  author when a `vineId` exists
  (`mobile/packages/models/lib/src/video_event.dart:1085-1088,1359-1375`).
- `VideosRepository.getVideosByAddressableIds` batches 20 coordinates, so 12
  unique pins fit in one relay batch. Funnelcake fallback and hydration can
  still cause additional requests
  (`mobile/packages/videos_repository/lib/src/videos_repository.dart:1469-1582`).
- The current grid prefixes owner-only upload placeholders ahead of published
  videos (`mobile/lib/widgets/profile/profile_videos_grid.dart:277-349`).
- The current fullscreen catch-up merge sorts newest-first and therefore
  destroys a pinned launch order
  (`mobile/lib/widgets/profile/profile_video_feed_view.dart:113-153`).

### Engineering findings relevant to future implementation

1. **Pin overlays and pagination need separate centralized sequences.** Current
   cold-load, cache, REST, Nostr load-more, enrichment, relay, and filter paths
   directly emit the filtered base feed. `_onRelaySnapshot` also compares the
   pin-augmented state against the unpinned base and can remove pins during a
   routine callback. Every video emit and comparison needs one centralized
   base-to-displayed derivation
   (`profile_feed_cubit.dart:204-207,255-258,299-302,536-538,576-579,631-633,648-659,678`).
   Keep raw base, normally filtered base, and displayed sequences separate.
   Backfill counts use the normally filtered base. The Nostr `until` cursor uses
   `min(_unfilteredVideos.map((video) => video.nostrCreatedAt))`, not
   `createdAt` and not pin-augmented `state.videos`; `createdAt` can represent
   the video's original `published_at` and move the boundary too far backward
   (`profile_feed_cubit.dart:404-460,510-516,727-744`,
   `video_event.dart:1090-1097`).
2. **A naive orderer can drop valid base-feed entries.** Pin-specific owner and
   visibility validation must apply to resolved pins, not re-filter the existing
   authoritative base sequence. Append that base sequence unchanged, minus
   exact duplicates.
3. **Overlapping copies are not reconciled.** When both inputs contain one
   coordinate, neither the feed nor separately resolved copy should win by input
   position. Different event IDs require NIP-01 winner selection by
   `nostrCreatedAt` descending then event ID ascending. Same-event enrichment
   precedence and merging are implementation policy that future engineering
   work must state and test explicitly. Preserve the authoritative base
   sequence position.
4. **Video replacement resolution is nondeterministic.** Mobile's
   `getVideosByAddressableIds` currently lets arrival order choose between
   multiple versions of one coordinate. It must select the raw NIP-01 winner by
   timestamp/ID before parsing and visibility filtering; otherwise an older
   playable version can incorrectly replace a newer filtered version
   (`videos_repository.dart:1529-1558`). Raw-resolved coordinates must be
   tracked independently from visible results: the current fallback path treats
   absence from the visible map as missing and can reintroduce an older visible
   Funnelcake representation of a canonical-but-filtered event
   (`videos_repository.dart:1561-1570,1613-1629`). Canonicalize across sources
   before visibility filtering, or otherwise prevent fallback for a coordinate
   already resolved canonically.
5. **`restartable()` is not enough.** Cancelling a Bloc handler does not cancel
   its underlying resolver future. A generation guard or `emit.isDone` check
   is required before a stale result mutates pin state.
6. **Grid-to-fullscreen identity is already lossy.** The grid constructs a
   de-duplicated displayed list but its tap handler substitutes `state.videos`
   whenever Cubit state is nonempty. Index, prefetch, and fullscreen seed can
   therefore differ from what the user tapped
   (`profile_videos_grid.dart:249-252,315-339,425-430`). The rendered published
   sequence must be authoritative, and the exact addressable coordinate must be
   threaded into fullscreen. Seeing that coordinate in a later live page does
   not by itself prove the live sequence has reconciled the displayed launch
   sequence; switching early can still drop or reorder seed videos.
7. **Exact identity must be threaded end to end.** Future work must include
   `FullscreenFeedBloc` and its tests in the addressable-coordinate path.
8. **Publish language overclaims certainty.** A fully settled query covers the
   configured relay fan-out, not every relay. `OK true` means accepted for
   writing, not durable. A lost `OK` can leave the remote outcome unknown.
   Failed mutations may keep local visible order unchanged; they cannot
   guarantee the previous order is still live everywhere.
9. **A snackbar alone is insufficient.** `.claude/rules/accessibility.md` requires
   `SemanticsService.sendAnnouncement` for snackbars and asynchronous visible
   changes.
10. **A new package requires complete CI ownership.** If engineering creates a
    repository package, it also
    requires `analysis_options.yaml`, a package CI workflow, a measured package
    coverage-floor entry, and the package CI/coverage floor checks.
11. **Use the supported analyzer command.** The supported command is
    `cd mobile && flutter analyze`, without positional directories.
12. **Mutation serialization is only process-local.** A future chain can order
    one app process, but two devices or Web and mobile can read the same base and
    publish competing replacements. New events normally need
    `max(now, selectedBase.createdAt + 1,
    lastLocallyIssuedOrAcceptedCreatedAt + 1)` for same-process ordering, because
    the next network-participating read may not return the process's last accepted
    write. The repository must fail or defer safely if that timestamp exceeds
    the relay's accepted future-skew boundary. Cross-device writes still follow
    NIP-01 replaceable-winner behavior.
13. **Filter changes cannot restore a pin omitted during resolution.** The
    current addressable resolver filters block, deletion, transport, expiry,
    and content policy before returning. The existing filter-change handler
    re-filters without refetching. The corrected design must either re-resolve
    missing coordinates when filter policy changes or retain canonical raw
    winners below the Cubit visibility layer.
14. **A nonnull `addressableId` does not prove kind 34236.** The model getter
    hardcodes `34236` for any nonempty addressable `d` value. Pin eligibility
    must also require the source `eventKind` to be the addressable short-video
    kind; a nonnull coordinate alone is insufficient.
15. **Mobile has no sanctioned pin glyph yet.** `DivineIcon` accepts only
    `DivineIconName`, whose current enum has no pin entry, and Mobile has no
    Phosphor dependency or pin asset. Reusing Web's Phosphor `PushPin` visual
    requires adding the selected SVG asset, enum/mapping entry, and mapping
    test; it cannot be requested as though the glyph already exists
    (`mobile/packages/divine_ui/lib/src/icon/divine_icon.dart:9-256`).
16. **Cache participation cannot satisfy a destructive read gate.**
    `queryEventsDetailed` defaults to all relay types, and the SDK counts a
    cache relay as a participant. A full-settlement result can therefore lack
    any network participant. Mutation reads must use
    `relayTypes: RelayType.network`, `requireAllRelaysSettled: true`, and refuse
    both `timedOut` and `noRelays`. DAO rows may add candidates but cannot
    satisfy network participation
    (`nostr_client.dart:833-1001`,
    `mobile/packages/nostr_sdk/lib/relay/relay_pool.dart:2054-2168`,
    `mobile/packages/nostr_sdk/lib/relay/relay_type.dart:13-21`).
17. **The base feed can reintroduce a hidden canonical version.** Current
    profile merging keys through helpers based on `stableId` and compares
    `createdAt`, which may come from `published_at`. An older visible copy can
    survive in the base feed even after the canonical pinned version is hidden.
    Suppress every base representation of an active candidate coordinate, not
    only Funnelcake fallback
    (`mobile/packages/videos_repository/lib/src/profile_video_merge.dart:11-35`,
    `mobile/packages/models/lib/src/video_event.dart:1085-1097,1370-1375`).
18. **Signing belongs to the configured signer.** The repository may validate
    and construct the event and orchestrate publication, but `NostrClient` and
    the configured signer own signing. Re-check current-account/owner equality
    immediately before publish and never pass private key material into the
    repository (`nostr_client.dart:470,661-667,765-773`).
19. **Empty and inconclusive mutation reads are different states.** A genuinely
    empty network-participating settled result can start from empty tags and
    content. Timeout, no participating relay, disposal, or incomplete
    settlement must refuse mutation rather than infer an empty list
    (`nostr_client.dart:833-1001`).
20. **Existing identity helpers are unsafe for exact pin coordinates.**
    `stableId` can omit the author, while profile-feed helpers lowercase the
    entire `d` value. Pin identity needs a dedicated type that requires the
    canonical lowercase pubkey and preserves case- and colon-sensitive `d`
    data byte-for-byte
    (`profile_video_merge.dart:11-16`,
    `video_event.dart:1085-1088,1359-1375`).
21. **Separate query and subscription setup creates a lost-update window, and
    current `subscribe()` has no readiness contract.** It returns synchronously
    while SDK relay setup continues asynchronously and exposes no participant
    set. Simply calling subscribe first cannot prove that every query relay was
    covered. Add an awaited combined network snapshot/live primitive that
    attaches buffering before send, reports participating relays, settles the
    initial snapshot across that same set, and then remains live. If an event
    becomes the winner before publication, restart reconciliation rather than
    knowingly signing against a stale base
    (`nostr_client.dart:873-884,1180-1294`,
    `mobile/packages/nostr_sdk/lib/relay/relay_pool.dart:1834-1962`).
22. **The last accepted revision is content state, not only a timestamp floor.**
    Funnelcake can acknowledge before storage, so an immediate network read may
    return the prior revision. The repository must retain the complete last
    locally accepted event as a base candidate; otherwise a second mutation can
    use a higher timestamp while still losing the first mutation's tags or
    opaque content (`nostr_client.dart:724-830`; current Funnelcake
    `crates/relay/src/relay.rs:1912-1915,2581-2594,2787`).
23. **Current routing cannot prove fullscreen launch identity.** Profile grid
    routes primarily carry index or event/stable IDs, and current fullscreen
    reconciliation can replace the seed as soon as the target merely appears.
    Exact coordinate plus a sequence generation must travel in route state;
    the launch prefix needs an explicit session lifetime
    (`mobile/lib/screens/feed/pooled_fullscreen_video_feed_screen.dart:119-142`,
    `mobile/lib/router/pooled_fullscreen_feed_route.dart:13-69`,
    `mobile/lib/router/profile_screen_router.dart:566-578`,
    `mobile/lib/widgets/profile/profile_video_feed_view.dart:113-153`).
24. **Code policy is not a release compatibility check.** The audit did not
    verify production `disallowed_kinds` or every target environment's normal
    read/write path. Release requires a disposable kind-`10001` publish and
    readback through each target Divine environment; a minority-relay `OK` is
    insufficient evidence that ordinary Mobile reads will surface the list.

## Recommended mobile decisions and known divergence

The consolidated report recommends these Mobile product choices:

- mobile prepends new pins and displays newest pin first;
- mobile caps creator-managed pins at 12;
- mobile manages and displays only owner-authored video coordinates;
- foreign and otherwise unrelated tags remain preserved as unrelated data.

The audit records their consequences: Divine Web currently appends, limits
adding at three, and displays
foreign-authored coordinates. Web will read more than three but refuses another
addition whenever the list already contains at least three video tags. Any Web
convergence is separate cross-repo work, not a hidden prerequisite of this
mobile task.

## Report Recommendations for Edge Cases

### 1. Web-written or mixed-client order

Web preserves stored tag order for the coordinate subset it displays. The
recommended Mobile design would also preserve stored order, but Mobile prepends
while Web appends. Without per-item timestamps, Mobile cannot infer a global pin
chronology for an existing Web-written or mixed-client sequence. Treat stored
order as authoritative and guarantee only that a Mobile Pin action moves that
video to the front.

### 2. Cap counting and imported lists over 12

Open Nostr data can exceed a local creator cap. Count every unique valid
owner-authored stored reference, including unresolved or hidden references.
Display from the first 12 candidates, preserve the complete event, permit
Unpin, and reject new Pin actions while the managed count is at or above 12.
Because invisible rows otherwise create a permanent cap lockout, an owner-only
recovery screen must list every managed coordinate independently of resolution
and allow exact removal without exposing or truncating the raw coordinate. A
resolved-but-hidden entry must use the same neutral placeholder as an unresolved
entry and expose no filtered metadata. Status is two-dimensional: visibility
takes precedence, then active-candidate versus overflow position.
Only visible videos resolved from those first 12 candidates are active displayed
pins and receive the badge, pin-rank semantics, and pinned-first position. A
stored overflow member can appear later through the base feed without the badge
or pinned semantics, while still offering Unpin to remove that stored entry.

### 3. Pin action while the first snapshot loads

Disable Pin until the first cache/relay snapshot establishes current membership
and count. Do not guess or publish from an unknown base.

### 4. Legacy or non-addressable video action

Omit Pin for a legacy/non-addressable video. Eligibility must use the source
event kind plus a nonempty `d` value, not `addressableId != null` alone.

### 5. Explicit actions and uncertain outcomes

Pin and Unpin remain idempotent intents after reconciliation; stale UI must
never turn one into the other. Definite failure may offer Retry, but timeout or
a lost acknowledgement offers Check again. Both actions perform a fresh
network-participating read before any publish, and an already-satisfied intent
finishes as a no-op.

### 6. Fullscreen session order

Freeze the grid's published-video launch snapshot for the fullscreen session.
Append unseen base pages without re-sorting the prefix, update canonical
metadata in place, and defer pin-order revalidation until the next grid or
fullscreen opening. Carry exact coordinate and sequence generation in in-app
route state; keep index-only URL restoration explicitly best-effort.

### 7. Accessible invocation and semantic position

Expose Pin/Unpin as custom semantics actions in addition to long-press. Define
pin rank as rank among visible active pins and grid position as the actual
rendered position, including owner-only upload placeholders. Preserve focus by
exact coordinate and announce a material revalidation reorder once.

## Implementation choices, not product facts

The following may be reasonable, but they must be justified as implementation
choices rather than treated as protocol requirements or established product
facts:

- SharedPreferences as the cache backend;
- caching the complete selected raw event;
- inserting rewritten managed tags at the first managed-tag slot;
- preserving extra fields on surviving managed tags;
- serializing mutations per owner;
- the exact cache backend, schema, expiry, and corruption behavior;
- the exact mutation result enums and internal retry state shape.

The Phosphor `PushPin` glyph has a current Divine Web precedent. Reusing it in
Mobile is the report's cross-client design recommendation, not a Nostr
requirement; implementation still has to add and verify the bundled asset.

| `OK true` means accepted by that relay, not durable everywhere | [NIP-01 lines 156-168](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/656cecc7c0a815b6a2b218d3b5d6f078b3f4dbab/01.md#L156-L168), `mobile/packages/nostr_client/lib/src/nostr_client.dart:742-761` | Verified protocol/client fact | Gate local progress on `acceptedByAny`; never tell the user it is durably saved. |
| Default full settlement can count cache participation, while current subscribe exposes no readiness/participants | `mobile/packages/nostr_client/lib/src/nostr_client.dart:833-1001,1180-1294`; `mobile/packages/nostr_sdk/lib/relay/relay_pool.dart:1834-1962,2054-2168`; `relay_type.dart:13-21` | Verified current client limitation | Add an awaited combined snapshot/live primitive over `RelayType.network`; require same-set settlement and refuse timeout/no participants. Cache may add candidates but cannot satisfy the gate. |
| Same-second replacement writes need monotonic time, subject to relay future-skew rejection | [NIP-01 lines 97-103](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/656cecc7c0a815b6a2b218d3b5d6f078b3f4dbab/01.md#L97-L103), `mobile/lib/utils/nostr_replacement_timestamp.dart:7-16`, current Funnelcake `crates/relay/src/relay.rs:1989` | Verified integration constraint | Floor against the selected base and the process-local last issued/accepted time; otherwise fail/defer safely. |
| Web pin mutations erase opaque `content` | Divine Web `src/hooks/usePinnedVideos.ts:101-108,143-152` at pinned `origin/main` | Verified current Web defect | Do not copy this behavior into mobile; track Web correction separately. |
| Web kind-10001 reads limit before applying the ID tie-break | Divine Web `src/hooks/usePinnedVideos.ts:41-51,73-84,131-141` at pinned `origin/main` | Verified current Web defect | Record cross-client divergence; Web correction is separate scope. |
