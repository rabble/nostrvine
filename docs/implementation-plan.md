## Technical Architecture

### Mobile App Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **State Management**: Provider or Riverpod
- **Networking**: HTTP + WebSockets for Nostr
- **Storage**: SQLite for local data, Secure Storage for keys
- **Camera**: camera plugin for frame capture

### Backend Stack
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (V8 JavaScript)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for media files
- **Processing**: gifenc for GIF creation, @cf-wasm/photon for image processing
- **Caching**: Cloudflare Cache API
- **Monitoring**: Cloudflare Analytics

### Protocol Integration
- **Nostr Protocol**: NIPs 1, 9, 11 for basic functionality
- **Media Sharing**: Custom NIP or existing media-sharing patterns
- **Relay Strategy**: Multiple relay connections for redundancy

## Success Metrics
- [ ] App successfully captures and converts image sequences to GIFs
- [ ] Content publishes to Nostr network and appears in feeds
- [ ] Backend processes media within acceptable time limits (<30s for small GIFs)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)
- [ ] Reasonable cost structure within Cloudflare free/paid tiers

## Risk Mitigation
- **Memory Limits**: Implement streaming and chunked processing
- **Processing Time**: Use asynchronous workflows with status updates  
- **Cost Control**: Set up budget alerts and usage monitoring
- **Nostr Adoption**: Ensure app works independently while integrating protocol
- **Platform Approval**: Follow mobile app store guidelines for content sharing

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1 foundation setup
2. Create minimal viable product (MVP) with basic GIF creation
3. Iterate on features based on user feedback
4. Scale infrastructure as needed for user growth
