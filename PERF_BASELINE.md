## 1. CI (GitHub Actions)

### Job durations

p50/p90 over the 13 most recent successful `Mobile CI` runs (and, for the
non-`Mobile CI` rows, over the most recent successful runs of their own
workflow within the same window). `q_p50` is median queue wait — the gap
between job creation and job start.

| Job | Workflow | n | p50 | p90 | max | q_p50 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Tests | Mobile CI | 13 | **599s** | 615s | 619s | 3s |
| Build & Deploy to app.divine.video | Web production deploy | 2 | 225s | 225s | 225s | 4s |
| Build Flutter Web Preview | PR preview build | 18 | 207s | 216s | 222s | 3s |
| Generated Files | Mobile CI | 13 | **198s** | 230s | 233s | 3s |
| Analyze | Mobile CI | 13 | 103s | 119s | 119s | 3s |
| build / build (`divine_ui` VGV) | Divine UI CI | 23 | 100s | 157s | 170s | 3s |
| Android Compile Check | service integration | 1 | 98s | 98s | 98s | 4s |
| Format | Mobile CI | 13 | 52s | 61s | 64s | 3s |
| Deploy PR Preview To Cloudflare | PR preview deploy | 21 | 36s | 41s | 42s | 3s |
| Detect App CI Scope | Mobile CI | 13 | **26s** | 29s | 30s | 3s |
| VGV Tag Gate | Mobile CI | 13 | 9s | 10s | 11s | 3s |
| ensure-linked-issue | PR Issue Link | 4 | 6s | 6s | 6s | 3s |
| mergeability | Mergeability Check | 20 | 4s | 6s | 7s | 3s |
| semantic-pull-request | semantic_pr | 19 | 4s | 6s | 6s | 3s |
| Mobile CI (gate) | Mobile CI | 13 | 3s | 4s | 4s | 3s |

**Queue wait is 3–4s across the board. CI is not queue-bound** — every second
of PR latency is real work.

### Critical path

Every `Mobile CI` job declares `needs: changes`, so the workflow's wall clock is:

```
Detect App CI Scope (26s)  ->  Tests (599s)   =  625s  (10m25s)
```

`Generated Files` (198s), `Analyze` (103s) and `Format` (52s) run in parallel
under that ceiling and do not set PR latency today. They *become* the ceiling
the moment `Tests` drops below them.

### Per-step breakdown (run 30142684388, a representative PR run)

**Detect App CI Scope — 26s total**

| Step | Time |
|---|---:|
| `actions/checkout@v4` (`fetch-depth: 0`) | **23s** |
| Detect whether app CI is required | 0s |

23 seconds of full-history clone to produce a changed-file list, at the head of
the critical path, on every run.

**Tests — 615s total**

| Step | Time |
|---|---:|
| Setup Flutter | 26s |
| `flutter pub get` | 10s |
| `dart pub global activate very_good_cli 1.3.0` | 9s |
| **`very_good test --optimization --concurrency=4`** | **558s** |

13,159 tests, 289 skipped, reported as `09:07` by the test runner.

**Generated Files — 224s total**

| Step | Time |
|---|---:|
| Setup Flutter | 17s |
| `flutter pub get` | 12s |
| **Verify native transport security** | **43s** |
| 22 ratchet / boundary guards (combined) | ~40s |
| **`dart run build_runner build`** | **101s** |
| Verify l10n generated files | 3s |

Of the 43s transport-security step, ~42s is `sudo apt-get update -qq` (28s) plus
`apt-get install libxml2-utils` (14s). `xmllint` is genuinely absent from the
`ubuntu-24.04` image; the actual guard runs in well under a second.

**Analyze — 119s total:** Setup Flutter 27s, `pub get` 12s, `flutter analyze` 71s.

**Format — 46s total:** Setup Flutter 17s, `pub get` 10s, `dart format` 11s.

### Cache behaviour

`subosito/flutter-action@v2` with `cache: true` is the only dependency cache and
it does hit — Setup Flutter costs 17–27s rather than a full SDK download.
`flutter pub get` at 10–12s is a warm pub cache. **No build_runner state is
cached anywhere**, so the 101s codegen verification starts from an empty build
graph on every run.

### Package workflows

All 57 package workflows under `.github/workflows/` carry `paths:` filters
scoped to their own package plus their own workflow file, so a PR that touches
no package code runs none of them. The six workflows without `paths:` filters
are `mobile_ci.yaml`, `mobile_service_integration_tests.yaml`, `semantic_pr.yaml`,
`pr_issue_link.yml`, `mergeability_check.yml`, and `mobile_pr_preview_deploy.yml`
— all of which are intentionally repo-wide. **There is no path-filter waste to
recover here.**

`--coverage` is *not* collected in the `Mobile CI` Tests job. Package workflows
do collect it, and they consume it (`min_coverage` gates), so it is not waste.

## 2. Test suite

### Where the 558s goes

Per-test durations were recovered from the CI log by diffing consecutive
reporter timestamps in the `Run Flutter tests` step of run 30142684388.

| Slice | Time | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Top 10 tests | 178s | 35.4% |
| Top 25 tests | 192s | 38.3% |
| Top 50 tests | 210s | 41.8% |
| Top 100 tests | 240s | 47.8% |
| Top 200 tests | 281s | 55.9% |
| All 13,158 attributed | 502s | 100% |

The distribution is extremely top-heavy: **the ten slowest tests own a third of
the suite.**

Caveat on attribution: the merged VGV bundle and the 18
`skip_very_good_optimization` files interleave their reporter output, so a
single large gap can be an artifact of a tagged suite's VM startup rather than
a genuinely slow test. Every entry acted on below was re-confirmed by running
its file in isolation.

### Confirmed hot spots

| Test | File | Measured |
|---|---|---:|
| `cleans failed non-resumable transient stop-motion renders` | `test/services/upload_manager_from_draft_test.dart` | **62s** |
| `throws when upload finishes in failed state instead of returning a completed upload` | same file | **62s** |

Both drive `UploadManager` to retry exhaustion. `UploadRetryConfig` defaults to
`maxRetries: 5`, `initialDelay: 2s`, `backoffMultiplier: 2.0`, and
`UploadRetryPolicy` sleeps that backoff in real time: 2+4+8+16+32 = **62s per
test**. Isolated file run before the fix: **3m08s**.

### Structural cost: the merged bundle is single-threaded

CI runs `very_good test --optimization --concurrency=4` on a 4-vCPU runner. The
optimizer collapses every untagged test file into **one** `.test_optimizer.dart`
suite, i.e. one process. The 18 `skip_very_good_optimization` files run as
separate suites alongside it. So for the overwhelming majority of the 558s,
**one of the four available cores is doing the work** and the concurrency
setting has nothing to schedule.

### Existing test-hygiene ratchets (already in place, not regressions)

The repo already freezes several of the things a perf audit would normally
flag, so these are *not* available wins:

- `scripts/baseline/future_delayed_tests.txt` — 35 files use `Future.delayed`
  under `test/`, shrink-only (epic #4337).
- `scripts/baseline/skip_tests.txt` — skipped-test count, shrink-only.
- `test/vgv_tag_baseline.txt` — 18 `skip_very_good_optimization` files,
  count may not increase.
- `scripts/baseline/test_unit_files.txt` — `test/unit/` frozen per-file.

Total explicit real-time sleep across `test/**` is **21.4s over 105
`Future.delayed(Duration(...))` call sites** — real, but an order of magnitude
smaller than the two 62s backoff waits above.

## 3. Dev loop (local)

Apple Silicon dev machine, Flutter 3.44.0 via `mise exec --`, run from `mobile/`.

| Operation | Time |
|---|---:|
| `flutter pub get`, warm workspace | 8.5s |
| `dart format --output=none lib test integration_test` (2708 files) | 44.5s |
| `flutter test <one 7-test service file>`, cold compile | 3m08s (18s after the backoff fix) |
| Full suite, `very_good test --optimization --concurrency=4` | 5m08s – 7m12s |

### Plain `flutter test` vs the optimized run

Plain `flutter test` compiles and spins a fresh isolate **per file**;
`very_good test --optimization` bundles the untagged files into one. Measured
head-to-head on an identical subset — 31 files / 277 tests, selected by
round-robin so it spans directories, same machine, back to back:

| Command | Wall | Tests |
|---|---:|---:|
| `flutter test --concurrency=4` | **60s** | 277 |
| `very_good test --optimization --concurrency=4` | **17s** | 277 |

**3.5x on identical work**, i.e. roughly 1.4s of per-file isolate and compile
overhead that the optimizer amortises away. `flutter test` is what
`CONTRIBUTING.md` currently tells developers to run.

The whole suite was not run to completion unoptimized; a partial run was
abandoned after a 50-minute sample reached 2,151 of ~13,159 tests, but that
sample was CPU-contended and is not a sound basis for a projection, so no
full-suite plain figure is claimed here.

### Full-suite run-to-run stability (local)

The optimized full suite is **not reliably green on this machine**, on
`main` as well as on branches. Across seven runs at
`--test-randomize-ordering-seed 12345`, one `origin/main`-equivalent run
failed on `personalEventCacheServiceProvider keeps queued events through
transient non-auth states` (a known CI-only flake, #6280); other runs failed on
`clips_library_bloc_test.dart` and `video_event_service_deduplication_test.dart`.
Each failing test passes in isolation. Treat a single red local full-suite run
as inconclusive and re-run before attributing it to a diff.

### Repo shape (verified, not assumed)

- `mobile/lib`: 1,400 Dart files
- `mobile/test`: 1,225 `*_test.dart` files, largest buckets `widgets/` (289),
  `services/` (280), `screens/` (185), `blocs/` (114)
- `mobile/packages`: 57 packages, **all** declared `resolution: workspace` under
  a single `workspace:` block in `mobile/pubspec.yaml` — one pub resolve for the
  whole monorepo, not 57. No win available here.
