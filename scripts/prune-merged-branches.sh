# ABOUTME: Reports which local branches and worktrees look safe to prune.
# ABOUTME: Report-only until deletion has a separately reviewed implementation.
#
# Why the obvious approaches are wrong here
# -----------------------------------------
# 1. `git branch --merged main` reports 5 of 1185 branches. This repo
#    squash-merges, and a squash rewrites the commit, so a merged branch never
#    becomes an ancestor of main. Ancestry is not the signal.
#
# 2. "Empty diff against main" does not work either. `git diff main <branch>`
#    is symmetric: a branch that merged months ago still differs from today's
#    main by everything that landed since. It reports 2445 changed files for a
#    long-merged branch here.
#
# 3. Name matching destroys work. Deleting everything matching "7606" took out
#    `fix/7606-semantic-tokens` — unpushed local work on a parallel attempt.
#
# So the useful signal in a squash-merge repo is GitHub reporting a same-repo PR
# to main with this head ref merged. Everything else is KEEP.
#
# 4. A head-ref name match alone misses review worktrees. A worktree created to
#    review someone else's PR sits on a scratch branch (`pr-8511`, `pr-8634`)
#    whose name is the head ref of no PR at all, so the name lookup scores it
#    KEEP forever. For those, ask GitHub which PRs contain the worktree's tip
#    COMMIT — an exact SHA, so it needs no name inference. That is MERGED-TIP.
#
# 5. Vetoing on any ignored file makes the script report nothing, ever. Every
#    Flutter worktree carries build/, .dart_tool/ and a pile of generated
#    plugin registrants, so Veto 2 below used to fire on all of them and the
#    run always ended "0 likely prunable". Ignored paths that a toolchain step
#    recreates from tracked sources are not work; ignored paths it does not
#    (a .env, a scratch note, a patch) still are. Only the latter veto.
#
# The bias is deliberate. A false KEEP costs disk. A false DELETE costs work
# that exists nowhere else — an unpushed branch has no backup. Both additions
# above keep that asymmetry: MERGED-TIP still needs Veto 1 to pass, and an
# ignored path that is not on the regenerable list still vetoes.
